72,"Re your AE topic ban appeal

Sorry, but it strains credulity (mine, anyway) to believe that you didn't realize that the Adam Mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among Lithuanian and Polish editors with whom you are well-acquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save, as you state here . (Recent article/talk page history: , ). You haven't edited the article since 2007  and you must have  thousands of  other articles that need improvement on your watchlist.  

You could have posted an article edit request to the PL noticeboard  re this, as you have for many articles during the past few months.

In my view the A.M. part of your appeal demonstrates.. what to call it... a lack of forthcoming-ness. The remainder of the appeal, in which you speak of WP's losses from your lack of participation, that's a different story that others can think over. 

If you remove the A.M. section I shan't contest your appeal, since lifting your topic ban now or in March doesn't make much difference in the long run. But I am concerned about that part - possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the article/talk page histories. You could either remove that section (since it hasn't been commented on there yet) or strike it. If you choose not to do either, I may bring it up at the AE appeal. 

I'd prefer that we keep the conversation here, but if you'd rather have it on my talk page, that's OK by me - if so I'll post talkbacks.",0

dab, I've started this new section because of the recent edits. I know the Iranian peoples (Iranic) is a ethno-linguistic group and includes both Iranian peoples and Iranian-speaking peoples. Verify the recent changes to this article (lead section, Slovenski Volk's edits). What's your opinion about the intro? Recent changes to """"Iranian nomadic people"""" section. I don't think there is a point to change that wikilink from related article to Iranian languages article, or changing Iranian to Iranian-speaking. I accept the current revision  by Lysozym. It's based on cited sources (Britannica and others). If there is a new strong theory, we can add it to lead section, but changing the recent sourced text/section OR ignoring them, is not a good idea.

Expanding claims of mistreatment with other witnesses
29-Apr-2010: It is time to greatly expand the section about Claims of Mistreatment, to include numerous other sources. Originally, that section was quickly created to begin the topic. At first, the issue was treated as a """"he said she said"""" dispute (when there are no other witnesses than just the 2 sides making claims). However, now, there are probably 10 or 15 witnesses to add into that section, including:
 In June 2009, Knox testified they repeatedly asked, """"Did you hear Meredith scream?"""" and she replied no, no, and no. When they insisted how was that possible, she claims that she said, """"I don't know; perhaps I had my fingers in my ears."""" That became: """"Knox put her fingers in her ears when she heard Kercher screaming"""" (invented false confession).
 Knox's father attended those trial hearings and he confirmed her statements as consistent with his conversations with Amanda, for years.
 Knox's father stated that a female officer linked to hitting Knox was charged with beating another suspect.
 One of the police officers (from that night) testified that Knox was so pressured during the intense interrogation that she starting screaming (not hearsay).
 Patrik L. (Knox's boss at the pub Le Chic) stated that he was also pressured and threatened by police officers on the same day.
 Author Douglas Preston, in several reports, has stated that he was also pressured and threatened by the same prosecutor, and commented about that in relation to Knox's testimony.
All such statements are allowed, per Wikipedia policies, because they are not WP:SYN synthesis, but rather reported in single sources describing the claims of mistreatment. The current text of the section must be expanded per WP:NOTCENSORED and WP:NOTPAPER. Expect the article to exceed 200kb, when similar basic details have been added. -  """,0

Also the following quote . . . “The orthostatic intolerance observed by Da Costa has since also been found in patients diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and mitral valve prolapse syndrome.[11]” is from the current page here , where it has been moved from the “Related to” section at the end of the page, up into the “Diagnosis” section where the CDC hypotension that I have just been discussing is referred to as being involved in the diagnosis of Da Costa’s syndrome and CFS. I did not put that comment there, and I did not put the reference number 11 which supports it there. You probably did, or at the very least you didn’t remove it as being wrong, so I don’t have to convince you of something that you already know and accept.

6015,"""I still cannot believe that there can be a controversy over our national anthem! This is absurd! What the hell happened? Freedom of speech, I am all for it. But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting """"immigrants"""". They're IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It's like subjecting to bullying, it's not bloody right! And the usage of """"God"""" and """"son"""" means nothing! It's a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school's chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be """"friends""""??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like """"The Beatles""""! You just don't do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It's IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can't make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: """"You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don't come here expecting us to change just for you."""" This is how a country should be. It seems unfair that we should change everything to be politically correct, just so that some bleeding heart out there can go to their bed -Oh, is that politically incorrect to the homeless? I'll change that to """"area of rest""""- and not grumble and whine, prepared to get up the next morning and petition to change all the lyrics of gospel music, or to remove all films that even mention a religious deity in a disrespectful manner. Please, I beg, I PRAY, (God forbid, heheheh) that we all come to our senses and realize """"Don't sweat the small stuff"""". Get on, toughen up, put your helmet on, keep on trucking. It's an imperfect world, you can't have your way all the time. If someone at high school insults you, you ignore it. You stay away from them. SO? Does that not apply to here?

The article on Morphological analysis started out as a relatively simple reference to Zwicky’s ideas, a definition of the process, a few references and some external links. I did not initiate this, but whoever did referred to me and the Swedish Morphological Society. This was fine with me: I went in and added a few details which I though relevant to the subject, but more or less left things as they were.

Then, a Mr. I. Tjahyo Sarwono came along with some very complicated diagrams, rather poor English, misinterpretations and explicit errors (a parameter he mistakenly calls a value, and a value he calls a parameter). I am in despair over this, as I don’t want morphological analysis to get a bad name because of a sloppy Wikipedia article.

Again, many people will think that not unreasonable in the context of his crime.  Roberts is engaged in petitioning the courts for a release date under the Human Rights Act.  This in turn will lead users to look to this article for biographical details.  The facts about his career in prison are irrelevant to an article about the crime he has committed, they belong in a biographical article.

Against that, biographical details of Roberts are slim.  He committed his crime aged thirty, hid out for a few months, and has been in jail for forty years.  Prior to the crime, he had done little of note to appear in a biography.  He has done very little of note for forty years.  Some more detail about his earlier life is probably available, but it would need a lot of leg-work around newspaper cuttings libraries to find it, and many newspaper archives of this nature went in a skip years ago without digital copies being made.  Therefore a biographical article will never be large, but the Wikipedia guidelines should be sufficiently broad to take this paucity of information into account.  —The preceding unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs).

WHERE DID I EVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT NAKHICHEVAN POPULATION IN 1830s, do you see me ever contesting those statistics? Do you even see me contesting 14th century material? Besides, Nakhichevan discribed there is NOT Nakhichevan with its current bordering. Grandmaster, don't get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. Taking Nakhichevan as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150,000, it was its most important period, after the 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by Armenians from the vicinities of Van, and after the desertion of Ani, people moved there. Julfa alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. The closest to the Abbas period you cam is of over 200 years, while I provided data which covered that period. You are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. Here, let readd the materials I have provided.

For the next four centuries, Armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of Ani and the Seljuk Turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. In the meantime, Persia ( Iran) experienced a revival under the Shi'i Safavids, who became the adversaries of the Sunni Ottomans. From 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in Armenia. Armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250,000 Armenians were forcibly transferred by Shah 'Abbas to Iran. By the seventeenth century, the Armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. The merchants of Julfa in Nakhichevan were among those who were brought to Iran by Shah 'Abbas; he moved them to a suburb of Isfahan where they built the New Julfa community. The support of 'Abbas and subsequent shahs enabled the Armenians to expand Iran's trade with India, China, Russia, and Western Europe. These merchants helped to make the Persian Gulf an important trade center. An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires by James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas C. J. Pappas. p. 44

Shah Abbas devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of Armenia, as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population. [from it] He settled some 13,000 families in the silk-growing northern provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan bordering on the Caspian. (Source: The Armenians and the East India Company in Persia in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries by R. W. Ferrier, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1973), p. 39)

Linda K. Steinmann in her work Shah 'Abbas and the Royal Silk Trade 1599-1629, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1987), pp. 68-74 covers the evacuation of the Armenians, and to a lesser extent elsewhere of Georgians, but nowhere does she say anything about any evacuation of Tartars.

Ina Baghdiantz McCabe covers the evacuation in her work The Shah's Silk for Europe's Silver: The Eurasian Trade of the Julfa Armenians in Safavid Iran and India (1530-1750), I don't see anything about Tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important Tartar population in Nakhichevan.

Josepho Barbaro while visiting the devastation reports destruction of Armenian towns and its desertion, not Tartars.

Sir William Ouseley during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the Armenian city during the evacuation.

In 1603 Shah 'Abbas, the great Safavid ruler of Persia, sent an expedition into Armenia in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the Turks. The death of the Sultan Mahmud III in December 1603 and the succession of his son Ahmed, a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy conquest in the course of which both retreating Turks and invading Persians plundered the Armenians. The Persian victory was followed by a forced emigration of the population to the Shah's capital of Isfahan. « That dragon of hell, Shah Abbas, nourished from the beginning in the ways of the serpent, saw with an eye of envy the prosperity of the Christians. » So Arakel of Tauriz, the seventeenth-century Armenian historian, puts it, and it was indeed the skill of new... Armenia was left desolates... (A Seventeenth-Century typological cycle of paintings in the Armenian cathedal at Julfa, T. S. R. Boase, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 13, No. 3/4 pp.323-324)

D.M. Lang writes that one of the two major reasons of the deportation was: ...he desired to make use of the industrial and commercial talents of the Armenians... (Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 32, No. 3 (1969) p. 622) Julfa population was so i",0

 Lead needs to meet MOS standards 

As it stands, the lead breaks MOS in several major ways:

 MOS:INTRO#Introductory text - In that is does not """"briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article"""".
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - In that it gives WP:UNDUE emphasis to male rape in the UK, yet section in """"Prevalence"""" covers 6 countries from which other examples could have been given. To quote MOS, """"emphasis given to material should reflect its relative importance to the subject"""" – male rape in the UK is no more important that in any other country in the world, therefore it should not be used as a singular example because this does not represent a worldwide view, particularly as anything related to anal sex differs per culture, religion and by law.
 The examples break the MOS:INTRO#Provide an accessible overview guideline which states: """"Do not hint at startling facts without describing them."""" The UK percentages are quoted without sufficient background to explain their relevancy this early in the article, there is no context because the lead is very short and uninformative.
 MOS:INTRO#Relative emphasis - """"Significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article"""" – the stated UK <3% and <5% figures are not mentioned in Male rape#United Kingdom, which would be a more appropriate place to account for these percentages, than in the lead in this disconnected manner.

The lead needs rewriting be someone who has contributed to this article and knows the sources well, it should be much longer based on the article's current length, it should be balanced and not given to undue examples from cherry-picked county data, per WP:NPOV.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.

 Phallocrypt or necklace? 
(Copied from Wikipedia:Reference desk/Humanities.)

Read about the koteka and lonkalonka on WIKIPEDIA. The description of the lonkalonka as a phallocrypt hung from male genitalia seems very peculiar, as I have seen an image of one with a twisted thong made of human hair. But to me it seems more like a necklace or ornament for the upper arm, as the thong is too short to get around the waist, and how it could be hung from the genitalia and called a phallocrypt, is beyond me. I have never seen pictures of aborigines wearing these lonka lonkas, so how do you know this is a phallocrypt? Someone who can explain how they are fixed to the body or lead me to an image so I am no more in doubt...
Are there pictures anywhere of the ornaments of jade and hardstone hung from the genitalia in South America, in other words, is this a fact? Nothing surprise me  about garments, but seeing is believing... 
The koteka, on the other hand , has got an historian/entropologist  to suggest that they could have been worn by people here in Scandinavia during the bronze age due to the many rock carvings of males with axes and phallos. And why not..?
Thank you.
Steinar Ådland

I see what you refer to in the Koteka article.  (It might have been better to put this comment on the discussion page there, by the way.)  The information you refer to was added by an anonymous editor who apparently could himself use some editing . . . """"lonkalonka"""" refers to the type of carved and decorated shell, not the type of item the shell is made into.  I have seen a picture of one of these with a 23"""" """"strap"""" attached, so I'm not ready to give the anonymous editor the lie just yet.

9826,"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE

a. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?

b. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. 

c. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.

d. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.

e. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.

Now to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.

So now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.

Now while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.

So GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.

I myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.

While some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.

Now I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.

Now the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.

Now Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.

The fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.

9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.

2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.

So 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.

My site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. 

Think about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due",1

hi Regarding deleteing this article as being not notable. Hi Regarding deleting this article as being not notable. the company was founded in 1824 and was an important ant horn comb manufacturer before the advent of plastics  it exported combs from England to America and the company was then very well known an ordinary thing like a comb used to be expensive as it was made of horn. The company Stockley and Wakelin does not trade any more so there is no commercial pourpose. There is another delete tag that that the article violates copyright as the material is elsewhere on the net. There is no copyright violation as the text elsewhere on the internet is my own. I am selling a Comb from made by Stokely and Wakelin on e bay and decided to do a write-up on Stockely and wakely - The comb is being sold for six pounds - so my intention to write the article on the company could hardly be for the purpose of flogging the one ccomb. Rather a comb was and is an important article of everyday use. There are no articles on horn combs which were used before plastics on Wikipedia and I was only trying to fill a gap by writing a article and improving on horn combs about what we used before plastics. Any way the article can be undeleted so that I and other wikipedians may improve on it and contribute to the knowledge of horn combs.",0

 Question about human name dabs 

This question concerns two disambig guidelines: (1) a disambig page should not include a red link unless the editor is confident that the subject is notable enough for an article, but (2) red links should be included for items that link to the disambig page without any of the available options in mind. The page I've been working on is Dave Johnson. All the red-linked names fit guideline (2)that is, each is linked, in an article, to Dave Johnson, but is not one of 
the blue-link Dave Johnsons. But some of them are not really notable: the comic-book artist, probably yes; the minor-league ice hockey player, the Survivor contestant, and the two software guys, probably no. So what's the best way to handle this? Leave the non-notable red links? Or go to the articles in which they are linked and unlink them? Or something else? As before, any advice welcome...  Talk """,0

Go to www.avoision.com and punch in what people said about him when he took on his title- those are the pople that looked to make trouble withthe guy on wikipdeia- now if anyone writes about any topic related to this guy they are labled as a hoaxer- but every peice of work I have written on is verifiable by the sources given and is truthful- Why should anyone put up with this constant accusation of hoaxing- there is no hoax, except for people placing the guy's name into a bogus Sacred Skull order article- why should eveything else be destroyed too- This is bullshit- and I'm sick and tired of that!!!!",1

 Daniel, your encyclopedia is a joke, and the article about Sanchez is a great illustration of the many and sundry reasons it is a joke. Every single one of your """"pillars"""" and """"policies"""" has been violated in the article itself, the discussion thread, and the administration of it. You and your cabal have allowed the subject to edit his own article; you've blocked verified facts from the article; you've demonstrated a lack of neutrality and good faith throughout; you've abandoned any pretense of common sense or even-handedness.

 The result is an article that is just plain false. But, you see, this doesn't matter at Wikipedia, because at Wikipedia all truth is negotiable, when means it is politically determined. The good thing is that, aside from anything that happens at the Sanchez whitewash page, the world at large is onto you and your crew. Wikipedia's lack of respect for truth, and its wholly capricious and abitrary administration, not to mention the falsification of biographies by its insiders and the insertion of corporate propaganda into articles, has been discovered.

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

 Reason? 

Was there any reason that you removed several links to album reviews?

I thoroughly read your """"ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL"""" and what I don't get is why then have you not removed every link to every review on all of Wikipedia? They are all external links. They all """"tunnel people away from the wikipedia."""" So why then are you singling out a single website and removing all of the links to their reviews?  If you would have actually bothered to visit all the links (which I somehow doubt, as all your reverts were popups-assisted.. whatever that means) you would find actual album reviews that IMO are much better than some of the crap that Pitchfork spits out. 

I'd also like to add that it is people like you who make me not want to contribute to Wikipedia, and the reason I've never joined. Instead of editing pages for the sake of contributing, you've designated yourself as the be-all end-all """"link remover""""  where """"link remover"""" means """"person who removes others' valid contributions to bolster his own self-importance.""""

I noticed your involvement in the discussion and your revision of the article creator's illegal closure of the AfD discussion, and I agree that reverting it was the right thing to do, but I'm curious how all this transpired in the first place. As you can see, the article has been deleted, so technically the discussion can't continue any longer (unless an administrator decides to restore it on the grounds of sabotage). What I would like to know is why an administrator deleted it in the first place. How could he or she not have noticed that:
a) The article was closed by someone other than an administrator, and
b) That the discussion was nowhere near the proper minimal closing date of five days after the start of the AfD discussion.

Furthermore, what do you think might have been the creator's motive for declaring Delete as the final decision? None of this makes much sense to me: the hoaxer willingly has his article which he has been fighting to keep for a while deleted, and an administrator wrongly and prematurely deleted the article for some strange reason.

Should we just leave the discussion as-is until an administrator sorts it out in a few days?",0

Albania Veneta

Dear Jimbo, 

I appreciate very much what you are doing with your Wikipedia. It is a great gift to all of us. But there are some """"points"""" that need to be improved, as you know. 

One is the presence of nationalistic groups that in a coordinate way want to impose their points of view without regard of what write serious historians. They usually proceed to ask for help from """"friendly to them"""" administrators and so obtain what they want. In Eastern Europe there are many of these groups (mainly ex-communists) and often are associated with hackers. 

What do we have to do with these nationalistic groups? In my case I can pinpoint what is going on with the articles """"Albania Veneta"""", """"Zadar"""", """"Istrian exodus"""", etc., where a group of known nationalistic fanatics (like one nicknamed in the english wikipedia as """"Direktor"""") are erasing and damaging what write others with serious and proven references. They use the typical misinformation with """"political pressure"""" of the Soviets in Eastern Europe. 

May be you have a serious and impartial administrator, who can help? 
Regards. 

This seems to be a dispute about naming conventions and reliable sources. Naming convention disputes should be solved by determining the names most often used by English speakers and using them without regard to ethnic sympathies. Disputes concerning reliable sources should be raised on WP:RSN. When different reliable sources disagree, they should both be represented in the article with a description of the differences in order to satisfy WP:NPOV. It seems likely that both sides of this dispute have relatively equally reliably sources which conflict.  Welcome to the Balkans. ←BenB4 """,0

 To all editors: please note that the concerns brought up by 58.96.94.12 were addressed in my last edit of the article. I added the """"Criticisms"""" section, which details the only peer-review paper published in a physics journal critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory while also giving a number of non-refereed book review articles which have been critical of the Omega Point Theory. Keep in mind that Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" tag is factually incorrect and violates Wikipedia's policies of WP:Truth, WP:NPOV and WP:Reliable Sources. Yet still, 58.96.94.12 complains, even though he as yet has not stated what is wrong with the current edit. It appears that 58.96.94.12 simply wants some notice or tag on this article telling people that it is bilge and that they oughtn't sake it seriously.

 I'm more than happy to work with 58.96.94.12, but he appears to be unwilling to be satisfied until he gets some edit which violates Wikipedia policy.  """,0

In my opinion, this will eventually become the most comprehensive and definitive Sweetest Day article anywhere. Contrary to what many may think, I am not anti-Sweetest Day. I simply believe Americans have a right to know the real history of what they are celebrating when it comes to holidays. The Herbert Birch Kingston Story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a verisimilitude, meaning it is very similar to the truth but not the exact truth at all. In fact, the dissemination of this story by Hallmark, American Greetings, Retail Confectioners International and countless other promoters of Sweetest Day is a form of mass deception and market manipulation. It has been going on for 85 years and has resulted in billions of dollars in revenues for these companies. But at what cost? America pays the cost of Sweetest Day in credibility, a trend which must be reversed if we are ever to win the hearts and minds of the world again. 

Please allow all images to remain in the article (unless they do not comply with Wikipedia standards). More will be uploaded soon! Also, please do not add any of the verisimilitudes currently used in the promotion of Sweetest Day unless they are characterized as such. Thank you again Reinyday! Robb",0

 Bibliography Revamp with Serialisation 

I'm proposing a revamp of the Bibliography section including the addition of a second table dealing with the serialisations of the Hornblower novels.
The serialisations were actually the first publication of all the works except the first novel so I think they deserve the space.

Currently I've put my proposed new content up at User:Jaa101/sandbox.

With the main bibliography table the main change I'm proposing is to have separate columns for the US and UK titles which are so often different.
This frees up the comments column for other information.
I've also made both the dates of publication and dates of the stories more precise.

One worry I have with both my tables is that I've linked extensively and repeatedly in them.
Normally one would link only on the first occurrence but, in this case, the tables are sortable so what's first may change.
I think it's acceptable as it is.

Finally, I've added mention of the first and most important omnibus """"Captain Hornblower"""" and also the """"Cadet Editions"""".

I propose to change the main page based on feedback.

Firstly the Youngboy article has already been deleted via the AfD process. I waited until after that that I put the pdf file you uploaded up for deletion. The article you scanned into the pdf is a copyright infringement, you do not have permission to either copy it or distribute it as you have done by uploading it to Wikipedia. By rights it should have been deleted straight away. Additionally I don't appreciate being accused of things that are patently untrue. Wikipedia has many rules. I suggest you make yourself aware of them before creating any more articles or uploading files that you have no right to.

This is ludicrous.  20:15, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

I agree entirely.  However, it is no more ludicrous than splitting Walsall or Dudley.   20:26, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

There are some good reasons to split district articles from their town.  They include (a) if the district is much larger than the town, and covers a lot of countryside (b) if the district includes town which have a strong identity.  That the borough/district is a city is not a good reason, because city status is a mere honorific and doesn't change facts on the ground.  If we split Dudley and Walsall we have to split Birmingham, Coventry, and Wolverhampton.  Note I am opposed to all splits of articles about metropolitan boroughs.   20:32, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

Nice to see this one's been reunified. It seems (seemed) a bit more ludicrous than spliiting Walsall (town) form Walsal (Borough) because there was nothing to indicate that Wolverhampton (city) contained more than Wolverhampton (town). I guess you were just making a point, and it doesn't.

I think the articles should be split on the basis of how much we've got to say about the two definitions. If we've only got a few lines about one it can live with the other.

I was indeed making a point, though it seems to have been missed.  If we look at Birmingham, say, the city includes Sutton Coldfield but the 'town' does not!   This, however, does not mean to say we should split the article.  I know that someone from Bradford said that Bradford shouldn't be split, even though Bradford is a far far clearer case for splitting than Dudley.   20:53, Mar 3, 2004 (UTC)

Wiki on Wolverhampton is 100x better than it was a year ago...

 Sport 

Wolverhampton Wanderers have never been in the current UEFA Champions League competition.  Wolves have only been in the English F.A. Premiership for one season (2002/03) since the Champions League began, and in that season they were relegated back to the lower-division Coca-Cola Championship.

The current Champions League competition only started in the 1992/93 season, the premier European club tournament before the Champions League was the European Champions Club Cup in which Wolves did compete in.

 

In fact, the UEFA Champions' League was a simple rebrand of the previous competition - which was created due to the European success of Wolverhampton Wanderers, and the reaction of the British press to the results. 

To quote from European_Cup_and_Champions_League_History: """"Before we declare that Wolverhampton are invincible, let them go to Moscow and Budapest. And there are other internationally renowned clubs: A.C. Milan and Real Madrid to name but two. A club world championship, or at least a European one - larger, more meaningful and more prestigious than the Mitropa Cup and more original than a competition for national teams - should be launched."""" - Gabriel Hanot  

 Remit of this article 
This is a thought of mine that's been prompted by the recent addition and removal of Perton and Bilbrook from the article.

What exactly is the remit of the article?  After all, there are several definitions of what Wolverhampton is.

The Local Authority area administered by Wolverhampton City Council.
The Wolverhampton Urban Sub-Area as defined by the ONS (or the """"city proper"""", perhaps?)  This include the LA area, plus the areas within South Staffordshire district that are physically attached (within 50m) to the urban area.  These would include Lower Penn, Perton, Coven Heath, Westcroft and Essington.
The above, plus areas that are within a few hundred metres of the Urban Area - such as Wombourne, Codsall, Bilbrook, Coven, Featherstone.  Most of these areas were recommended for inclusion in the Borough by the",0

Hi, and sorry for the delayed response. There's no ironclad rule agaisnt it but generally Urban Dictionary would fail the policy on reliable sources because it does not """"have a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy"""". That doesn't make the definitions there wrong per se, just potentially unreliable. A word or phrase with genuine currency would be extremely likely to also be defined somewhere other than Urban Dictionary, so anything reliant on UD alone as a source is unlikely to be acceptable.

 Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status 

The Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.). Accordingly, the mere exercise of a university is not subject to authorization and is based on the freedom of science and economic freedom, as stated in the preamble of the now decayed authorization of the State Council on 14 February 2006. ISSEA sa is then free to confer titles, without that this requires an estimate accreditation or recognition subsidies and must be considered as recognized by national law (judgment of the TAF of 13 August 2013, B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 11). The CRUS, is not responsible neither for accreditation or for recognition under the LAU and the list developed by this authority can be at most a working tool, not expounding this list legal effects (judgment of the TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 13Equni (talk)  Recognition and university accreditation in Switzerland: rulings clarifying The legal issues on the real value of the recognition and accreditation University in Switzerland have been resolved by some judgments of the Swiss Federal Courts. Recognition in the university system The Federal Court judgment with 5A-376/2008 of 7 May 2008 confirmed that the cantonal license to use the name """"university"""" is a recognition of the status of universities in the Swiss university system, and say the opposite is true. That judgment has therefore 'refuted the thesis of the Education Department of the Canton Ticino, in the person of Mr. Sandro Rusconi who mistakenly consider it a simple authorization to use the name University accreditation The Federal Court judgment with 2P.88 / 2006 of 20 January 2009 stated that the accreditation is not mandatory and that to pursue the occupation university in Switzerland do not need a state authorization, as well as the non-accreditation or fails such a procedure does not affect in any way the freedom to engage in teaching and research university. The Federal Court Ammnistrativo with judgment B-1567/2011 of February 8, 2012 has confirmed that the university accreditation is a simple quality mark Optional without any legal consequences. In other words it is a recognition of the validity of this or that title or this or that university from the state.

Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.",1

And why you got to complain every single time your not getting laid. 
You douche bags are a lot of the same. """"Dude let's go. This place is full of grenades"""" Always trying to look cool, like it's a full time career.

Inconsiderate, ignorant, you drink you get belligerent, 
you think anybody finds you amusing? No, no, no. Not even a little bit. 
You always find a way to stop all the fun 
like, when you scream """"party foul"""" at the top of your lungs. 
Dear Jschnur, I caught you bragging again. 
Trust me man, nobody gives a damn what frat you were in.

""""I don't see much evidence that this user is constructively engaged in improving this page or basing content on reliable sources."""" This is equally as offensive as were the comments of the other editors- nor is the statement even true. You don't see much evidence because my properly sourced submissions are reverted. I ask you or any other editor to show me one misuse of a source. This is a a link to my last edit on the entry. diff  I include it as it was correctly sourced using per-approved sources that had consensus and the changes concerning definitions in the entry were discussed on the talk page and also had consensus..
Disruptive edit, not an improvement? That opinion is not supportable.

The changes were made to bring the entry into compliance with WP:lead standards because the definitions were faulty. .

Now I ask you (again #2), what content have I submitted on that page that had an unreliable source as you've alleged when blocking me? You have made the same unfounded accusation as the other two editors.  Regardless of what you think of another editor's edits, keep that to your self!

Now I formally ask you to Point out the reference are referring to in your negative posts about me!  This is not a difference of opinion.  It is a fabrication and a personal attack upon my credibility.  Comment on content, not on the contributor. You commented on both! and were not truthful in your comment about the content and sources.  Derogatory comments about other contributors may be removed by any editor.  Instead, you added more of them.

In addition, for like the fourth time, this person decides to call me """"a full blown believer and pusher of this conspiracy theory"""" which I repeatedly denied.  I took offense.
Both other editors received talk messages from me. After you came along, One editor user: Dbrodbeck apologized for his statement..  I appreciate that and accept his apology and will tell him so when unblocked.  The other person user:Brangifer received a call for truce on his talk page but refused to retract his comment.  He has repeated attacked my credibility and now has thrown out a serious accusation without one shred of foundation or substance and banned me from his talk page.

To have User:scray come along and say stuff like """" Regardless of what you think of another editor's edits, name-calling (a personal attack) won't go well.""""  I did not call a name. I called a spade a spade and gave good evidence that I was calling it as it presented itself.

 Removed content 

I removed the following content which seems to be not particularly well-sourced, and a bit off topic - seems more related to a public relations type page, but I can't find exactly where it'd fit best, if anywhere at all.

""""==Two-Way Communication in Public Relations==
Two-way communication can be contrasted with [[broadcasting]], a one-way form of communication.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Two-way communication uses communication to negotiate with the public, resolve conflict, and promote mutual understanding and respect between the organization and its public(s). 

There are different types of two-way communication in public relations; symmetric and asymmetric.

'''Two-way asymmetric'''
*Employs social science methods to develop more:'''Persuasive communication'''
*Generally focuses on achieving short-term attitude change;
*Incorporates lots of feedback from target audiences and publics;
*Is used by an organization primarily interested in having its publics come around to its way of thinking rather changing the organization, its policies, or its views.

'''Two-way symmetric public relations'''
*Relies on honest and open two-way communication and mutual give-and-take rather than one-way persuasion;
*Focuses on mutual respect and efforts to achieve mutual understanding;
*Emphasizes negotiation and a willingness to adapt and make compromises;
*Requires organizations engaging in public relations to be willing to make significant adjustments in how they operate in order to accommodate their publics;
*Seems to be used more by non-profit organizations, government agencies, and heavily regulated businesses such as public utilities than by competitive, profit-driven companies.Source: Managing Public Relations by James E. Grunig and Todd Hunt, 1984

And try to see my point: I DO accept the possibility of being wrong. I try to stay as objective as I can, but till now, I heard rather unilateral accusations, rather than specific proofs and facts. That’s the diference between us, when confronted with discrepancies, you sir seem to deliberately ignore them, because the authors you read do so; me, I start my own research. I have spoken personally to at least 50 people, who lived through those terrible times, not Jewish, unfortunately, but certainly not antisemitic. (It’s not much, but at least I did it; what’s YOUR personal research ?) They are spread over all major Romanian regions, my witnesses, covering many different trades. Not one, mind you, ever heard, much less witnessed, any antisemitic violence ORDERED BY ANTONESCU or his government on Romania – old territory. Please quote contrary evidence, first hand if possible. I confess, I couldn’t find Jewish witnesses, all my Jewish friends and aquaintances are too young for that, but I’m still looking. 

And excuse me, the accusation of “incomplete quoting” the Wiesel repport is ludicrous. Would you want me to quote the full text ? My point was that even in a report that I consider unilateral and biased (like a trial with prosecutors only and without defenders), important facts like apparently inexplicable acts of mercy and a definite orriginal Jewish policy, totally opposed to that of Germany, at a time when Germany was still all powerfull, could not be remained unnoticed. The Wiesel Commission itself, sir, could not ignore those facts; how can you ? 

The Wiesel Report allowed such colossal mistakes as blaming a whole state, a whole nation, I remember of having read the phrase “the crimes committed by Antonescu and the Romanian nation against Jews”. You never blame a whole nation, a whole population. 

 The blame sir, is INDIVIDUAL, as Frederic Forsythe says. And so is the salvation. 

An intelligent man knows that when you deal with great numbers, you have to apply statistics, over-generalization is one of the  most unforgivable acts. And such a phrase lies in the same report in which there are mentioned pro-Jewish acts, both from government level and from individuals, only to underline that they don’t count. And you want me to take such a report as gospel truth, a model of impartiality and justice ?

MR MIRCION, kindly, get a grip on yourself. To state that Antonescu is “my hero” proves you didn’t even tried to read what I wrote; if so, how and what are you criticizing ? 

I repeat, to be sure Antonescu was involved in war crimes. Commited in war zones. He was not involved in crimes against humanity, in cold-blood premeditated murder, based on an ethnic cleansing policy, on the contrary, he tried, and partially succeeded to stop it, against considerable political pressure and certainly against the major antisemitic trend in a Germany dominated Europe. He is to be condemned, of course, but NOT for the wrong reasons. At the time of the reckoning, both good and bad deeds should be put in the balance. Romanians, sir, have the right to criticize, accuse, and condemn Antonescu. Not the Jewish people from Romania-old kingdom, since Antonescu saved 300 000 of them while sending almost half a million of his own people to their death. 

To be sure, this is just my opinion, but it’s based on facts.

 If you have explanations for the points lined up in the answer above to Mr Dahn’s reply, based on facts, not on second-h",0

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Chilean 1973 Junta.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use  to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

PS As for Grove, do you have another source which has corroborated Grove's statement.  His is the only paper on the Doji bara famine.  The Doji bara famine, moreover, predates any censuses of British India (which began in 1871).  His mortality statistics are based on methods that are conjectural and not rigorous.  Moreover, Grove is an environmental historian, not a historian of colonial India, and consequently, not able to assign political blame.  Is there any reference in the paper to the administration of British India?  Is there any evidence (by way of political culpability) in the paper to back up this one isolated sentence?  Cherry picking isolated sentences in the one and only paper on a topic (involving less than rigorous methods) is WP:UNDUE.  As Jimbo Wales himself says, """"If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it does not belong in Wikipedia regardless of whether it is true or not and regardless of whether you can prove it or not, except perhaps in some ancillary article.""""  In this case, Grove is the only author that has blamed the British, and that too only for not providing relief from the famine, not for causing the famine.

I have reverted your edits to these two articles. Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.

 Wikipedia and copyright 
 Hello Jbeck8924, and welcome to Wikipedia. Your addition to 401 Derby has had to be removed, as it appears to have added copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder. While we appreciate your contributing to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from your sources to avoid copyright or plagiarism issues here.

You can only copy/translate a small amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double quotation marks ("""") and a cited source. You can read about this at Wikipedia:Non-free content in the sections on """"text"""". See also Help:Referencing for beginners, for how to cite sources here.
Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information in your own words and structure, in proper paraphrase. Following the source's words too closely can create copyright problems, so it is not permitted here; see Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue.) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to verify information and to demonstrate that the content is not original research. 
Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is Wikipedia:Copyrights. You may also want to review Wikipedia:Copy-paste. 
If you own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a designated agent, you may be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. However, there are steps that must be taken to verify that license before you do. See Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
In very rare cases (that is, for sources that are public domain or compatibly licensed), it may be possible to include greater portions of a source text. However, please seek help at the help desk before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources may not be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you do confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see Wikipedia:Plagiarism for the steps you need to follow.
Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied or translated without attribution. If you want to copy or translate from another Wikipedia project or article, you can, but please follow the steps in Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia.

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be blocked from editing.

4159,"""Ten commandments, part 2==
I'm getting tired of having to scroll through several pages to get to the bottom, so I'm starting a new section.  

Let's take a step back.  This article is the """"Ten Commandments"""".  That is the verses in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 that are universally called the Ten Commandments; the ones that are debated about being placed in public school; the ones that are talked about as the fundamental of morality.  It is not about the list in Exodus 34.  The article is not about the use of the words """"עשרת הדברות"""" in the Bible; it is about a particular Bible list that is called The Ten Commandments.

This is an important point, except that I would go further.  This article is not about a particular Bible list.  This is article about a cultural artifact known as """"the Ten Commandments"""" that is strongly influenced by the Bible.  Sections of the Bible have been translated, moved around, edited, cropped, etc., and then declared """"The Ten Commandments"""".  I think that many people think of the 10C as something where you just open the Bible up and there they are.  That's just not the case.  The cultural concept of """"The Ten Commandments"""" is significantly extra-bibical.  Haven't you ever seen that Late Show bit where Letternman takes someone's words and edits them to say something different from what they actually said?  You can't just say """"well, I've quoted the Bible, so it's a legitimate representation of the Bible.""""

You feel that this statement is not sourced.  Yet I am sure you agree that the number """"Ten"""" in the title """"The TEN Commandments"""" comes from the Hebrew phrase """"aseret had'varim"""" even if you personally think that this was a mistake. 

Actually, I remain unconvinced of this.  I have seen no convincing evidence that the Bible using the word """"ten"""" and people referring to the """"ten"""" commandments are causally connected.  I certainly am willing to accede that this may say more about my knowledge of Bible research rather than about the 10C.

I do not think there is a better way of telling the reader that the etymology of the title """"The Ten Commandments"""" for the list in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 is from the Hebrew """"aseret had'varim"""". 

So there are two problems immediately apparent here.  First, you have no cite for the claim that this is the etymology.  Secondly, even if it were the etymology, that would be an issue completely separate from whether the Bible actually says that.  After all, the etymology of the term """"Uncle Tom"""" goes back to a book by Stowe, even though the Uncle Tom character is not in fact an """"Uncle Tom"""".

Any reasonable person reading the text as it now is would conclude that the Bible, in the Ex 20 and De 5 passages, uses the term """"עשרת הדברות"""".  I don't see why you insist on retaining this misrepresentation.

This is a notable issue because, as you mentioned, the Ten Commandments are widely represented as being fundamental to Western Civilization.  Besides the numerous other problems with that claim, the fact that much of the importance given to """"The"""" Ten Commandments is extrabiblical opposes that view.

That's not what I heard. I read somewhere that the verses were about Beyonce but from years earlier. at the time of Kingdom Come, Beyonce was 25, but the verses refer to the girl being 23.

They are clearly back together in Kindom Come, and the song could have been from a rough patch in '04-'05. Both theories are possible and should be included in the article

 No problems then, and candor I have in spades. People around here from Jimbo on down definitely know when I have a peeve, though these days, seems like most I knew well have quit. Loosing people like CBD, Mel Etitis, and David Kernow I really have to chalk up to the endless strife and hostility of these episodic outbreaks of someone creating a dislocating change... Deletions of something just created, qualify for that, if you'll allow the personal reference. I don't hold grudges, as many can tell you, so I'm taking you at your candorous word too!

 Admittedly, the sweetness and light bit gets cloying all the time, so putting some mustard on things is actually compensation for the the otherwise thankless efforts, now and again. I know that's bent, but self-honesty let that out, so may as well admit it. Shaking preconceptions in those that forget WP:IAR is perhaps the best legacy I sometimes think I can give around here... particularly the young folks don't have enough life experience to know when to live and let live and so ignore a rule or guideline... 

This silly series I'm working is a case in point. Ill served by it when I checked our coverage when I stumbled across it in November, I'm compulsed as I have been in many areas here to try improving it, mainly by adding to it, for it was cut by a harsh, ill-judged ruthless person. The original writers went on to other tasks in life's stages, so a nicely put together set of articles covering the series got run over by the mac truck of one guy, aided passively by 2-3 others, pushing the new notability rules so they wiped out hundreds of man-hours of work, in some nifty and salvageable articles. Turned them into around 180 redirects and put together a paltry in-universe list article that had almost zero value... leaving things well enough alone would have been far better. Kidz!!! Sigh.

3123,"It is just like synthpop being a precursor to techno. Synthpop is white music whilst Techno is black music. Radio Babylon is dub, it provides typical dub technique (small room/overreverbed room), and the only thing it can be called 'dnb' for is the combination of percusion with k-s-k-s-.. rhythm, which is hardly an invention of MBM. Four arguments to Radio Babylon opposition are:
MBM is an experimental band. (there has been already noted somewhere that Kraftwerk's 'Radioactivity' was once 'recognized' a first dubstep track by some)
Dub is a genre of vast (Can you definetely state no simillar dubtrack has been written just before /or much before Radio Babylon?)
MBM's track isn't related to Rave, as Dub (or reverb technique) isn't related to Rave
Two years passed till another tracks of jungle have appeared if Radio Babylon is considered a first track.

Arguments in favour are:
MBM are British, so they are connected somehow to British Rave scene.
Track's rhythm is quite a simillarity with jungle music rhythms.

Second argument is like 'drumfunk was created in the times jazz/funk drum improvisations appeared (20s to 60s)'. The first argument is weak without the second one.

One more argument that MBM's track is sampled in some jungle tracks as a straight shortcut to jungle music roots according to creators of those tracks. But it is quite a pov argument.

I don't know the roots of Rave, the scene was dominantly white, and the guy who brought acid house to UK was white too. But who started using 45rpm breakbeat over 4-tofloor is enigma to me personally.

751,"Heaven of God 
For the atheist anarchist, the subject is Heaven, and it is religion, moron> I saw your kind at University, go feed yourself in the mountains.

To understand Heaven, then God must be understood:

 1. God is the all powerful supreme being of the Universe.
 2. Universe is defined as everything that is seen and unseen, and defined as everything known and unknown. Any concept of a multi-universe shall be defined as the mathematical subspace where there can be many subspaces, but only one Universe. A mathematical subspace is a subset of dimensions that does not have to include all other dimensions. The subspace we exist within can be a subspace of a larger subspace. The subspace that includes all dimensions is the Universe itself. The Universe itself is a subspace that includes all dimensions.
 3. God is either above the Universe as the creator, or part of some subspace of the Universe, or both above and part of the Universe. The fourth condition that God is not part of the Universe, and God is not above the Universe negates God's existence; therefore, the fourth condition is not considered a valid condition of God.
 4. God is supreme over the Universe. It is God's creation and obeys God's rules. Each rule can be obvious or non-obvious, and each rule can be hidden or allowed to be known.
 5. God has the ability to create and destroy energy. Without such a thing, then the Universe simply exists and is eternal and everlasting with no known explanation of its ability to exist; there can still be God as a supreme being of the Universe in such a condition, but God's energy ability is changed to the ability to manipulate energy without the ability to create or destroy energy.
 6. God is smart, is intelligent, is wise, has knowledge, is a creator, is good, is benevolent, has mercy, and has understanding. God has these abilities that are significant as the supreme being of the Universe.
 7. God expects God's creation to do well, since as a creator, then the Universe was created for God's purpose and enjoyment; therefore, life elements of God's creation, such as people, are expected to improve their own condition for their benefit and exercise wisdom, understanding, and knowledge when possible to exercise such thingsintelligence is good.
 8. Because God is supreme, then Heaven and its rules of existence are defined by God.
 9. God not only deals with people of Earth of our Sol system of the Milky Way galaxy, God is a supreme being that can interact with the entire Universe in whole, or God can interact with the Universe in part; therefore, God truly understands some of the issues and survival strategies of life, and this implies that God may be truly forgiving and God may expect certain behavior for the improvement of ourselvesto survive and prosper is important.
 10. It is always believed that God likes people, so help from God can be asked by petition for help or intervention using prayer.
 11. God likes to be acknowledged from God's own creation, so it is good to acknowledge God as the benevolent intelligent creator of the Universe.
 12. Love God. Love is a survival strategy of people that helps to define society, family, nation, benevolence, and many good things of life. Be who you are as a person and love God, and God is expected to understand this as love is part of the defining qualities of people.

God has created the Universe and has the ability to define Heaven in any way. Each person can get a personal Heaven, or Heaven may be a interaction for people, or Heaven may be a combination of both personal and interaction of people. Heaven is always defined as a good place; but, a personal Heaven can also be a personal Hell tailored to your life, attitude, and existence where God could give us, by observation, an environment where the individual prospered. The personal Heaven and Hell would be much like an metaphorical ant farm that is designed for ants, but you would not expect things like body building equipment in the ant farm, and the ant farm would function in a way ants survive, and this can be bad news for people who were ruthless where their environment was ruthlessness as a survival strategy (visit a zoo and see how the environmentshowever limitedare tailored to the different animal species).

God can define Heaven in any way, and Heaven is defined as a good place, but as a supreme being God can allow many things, and maybe God might include a body building set for the metaphorical ant farm, so the possibilities of Heaven are expected to be many, if not endless possibilities. God is benevolent in Heaven and the possibilities are many. Love God.",0

 Fishy 

Have a look at the Tautog infobox? It's showing """"struck"""" rather than """"stricken"""", & won't accept a change to that without wiping out the section entirely. Nor will it accept an add """"as built"""" without putting it in a weird place...   
It appears that it's using a different infobox template than the other related submarine articles that uses """"struck"""" instead of """"stricken"""" and doesn't have an """"as built"""" field.

With regard to your numbered points above:

 Thank you for confirming that my revert didn't break the template; it was already broken. If you repaired it, you should have said so in your edit summary, rather than just labelling it """"coordinate test"""". If you wished to repair it and implement a test, you would have been wise to do so in to separate, and clearly labelled , edits, so that your test could be reverted separately.
 Ditto.
 Your use of """"should"""" here is incorrect; """"should"""" expresses a advisory or mandatory position, you are expressing an opinion. 
 You again make a pejorative and fallacious insinuation that my understanding is deficient, Kindly desist. You also ignore my point about the data provided at GeoTemplate. 

Your claim that my reversal of your """"test"""" edits, clearly labelled as such, is POINT is mistaken (anyone can see in edit histories that I have replaced every instance of coordinate in article space, including the majority not initiated by you). The were not 10,000 instances of coordinate, as you well know. Likewise my edits to implement a standard template in place of one deprecated by consensus. Since you were the only person opposing that consensus, the POINT edits seem to be yours. My edit history shows multiple instances of me converting other coordinates templates on pages you have not edited. Kindly desist from making false slurs. If you have any evidence to support your slurs, take the matter back to WP:ANI, where my edits, contested by you, have already been described as """"fine"""", not least in the light of your """"incivility and disruptive editing"""".

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

You are obviously British, and you sound like a Communist. Communists are just as evil and very similar to Nazis. You are the ones who started the slavery in the Americas in the first place. You are the ones who illegally colonized and occupied the world in the first place. You are the ones who made it illegal for Jews to return to Israel and denied them entry into Britain and British colonies during World War II, thus helping the Germans carry out the Holocaust. Furthermore, you show yourself to be a typical anti-Semite. You lie and say that Jews colonized Israel. Jews did not colonize Israel. Jews returned to Israel. The Arabs were the ones who illegally colonized and continue to illegally occupy Israel. Nableezy is also an anti-Semite. He is an Arab supremacist and claims that Israel is “genocidal, Jewish supremacist, racist, terrorism sponsor, human rights violater (sic), misogynist, fanatic, and repressive.” Europeans and Muslims should not be allowed to edit articles about Jews.

6159,"Please stop vandalising my writings in the dog article 

Nothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.

You are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.

You need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. 

If you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.

As a typical example of the damage to which this non-collaborative editor Jonathan is willing to do to push his views, see this statement he recently back put in: """"Ramana Maharshi's teachings have been further popularised [sic] in the west as neo-Advaita via H. W. L. Poonja and his students.{{sfn|lucas|2011|p=94}"""" That is of course total opinion that """"neo-Advaita"""" conforms accurately to Ramana's teachings since Ramana even had a problematic relationship with traditional Advaita, and it is a claim widely disputed as well as conflicting with the rest of the article. A close reading of Ramana's words in context shows little evidence that would support such a claim at best. Poonja himself dismissed the neo-Advaitan's claims of enlightenment in an interview with David Godman. We need an end to iron-handed editing by fiat and genuine consensus building. Which will require reigning in this rogue editor.   """,0

The best way to move articles is to use the Move link on the left-hand side of the page.  Cutting and pasting the text of articles from one to another only moves the text; it does not move the edit history.  Fragmenting the edit history is both a nuisance and a legal issue, because when we don't provide a list of all contributors to an article, we are violating the GNU Free Documentation License.  For this reason, you should always use the built-in move feature.  If the location you wish to move to already exists, you will have to convince an administrator to do the move.

Because only administrators can undo a page move, please always make sure that other editors agree to your move before carrying it out.

 False inormation in the article 
As you would expect, the propagandists would say and do everything to mislead us. They once again proved themselfs to be the proven LIARS we alreayd knew they were since the article wrongly states that the darker picture with the """"fall-off"""" effects is the edited one, which is pure BS.

The original photo is the one with the """"fall-off"""" effect which was printed in The West Australian already back in august 2, 1969 (~6 min in this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMuTiziCszU) while the lighten up picture is the EDITED version who came out much later. So unless the propaganda trolls cant find a version of THEIR claimed original version dated EARLIER than august second 1969, i suggest them to SHUTUP.

Proven fake: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Aldrin_Apollo_11_original.jpg/179px-Aldrin_Apollo_11_original.jpg

Youtube is not a reliable source for information about a conspiracy theory. Is there a reliable source available that supports your claim?   

 The Buzz Alrdin photo is explained at Examination_of_Apollo_Moon_photographs#Issues with crosshairs in photos.   You talkin' to me? 

The video shows a guy holding up the actual newspaper from 2 aug 1969 to prove that the """"fall-off"""" picture is how the original one looked like, but then its youtube who isnt a reliable source!?  your desperate try for making a point is laughable... but i wouldnt expect more from a propaganda TROLL.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 91.145.38.53   

 No, that newspaper doesn't show what the original one looks like.  The original is a transparency that is in NASA's vaults.  They made prints that were widely reprinted. See this for more information.  You talkin' to me? 

Bullshit! excuses from NASA wont make it true! you have the history of that picture in the video i linked to and even the NASA site you linked to shows the fact that the darker picture is the first one, the original from 1969, while the more lighten edited version came out 1975. So why you arguing? you dont have a chance here. As i said, BRING UP a picture dated earlier than 2 aug 1969 or SHUTUP - its that simple!

91.145.38.53, please stop insulting other editors and please sign your posts, just put four tildes at the end .   

I dont tolerating having my talk session closed, this is what the propagandists do? censoring their opponents!
Unless the propagandists cant bring up the picture THEY claim to be the original together with a date which needs to be earlier than second of august 1969, i will change the article. False misleading information should never be tolerated! Its already proven that the """"fall-off"""" darker version IS the original. If anyone wants to argue, then bring up! 91.145.38.53

 Suggested changes (received via email) 

Hi all,

The following proposed changes were received via email to OTRS. I submit them to the talk page for consideration and adaptation by anyone who is interested in the subject matter:

Nathan  Sonenshein (2 August 1915-April 13, 2001) was a rear admiral in the United States
Navy. A native of Lodi, New Jersey, Sonenshein began his four-decade naval career by
attending and receiving a commission from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1938. In 1970, he was
head of the Navy's Bureau of Ships, just before it became the Naval Ship Systems Command.
.

His thirty-six year career in the Navy spanned an era that began on the eve of World War
II and lasted into the seventies.

He was decorated for distinguished performance as Chief Engineer of a carrier during the
Korean War. Later assignments in the Bureau of Ships included that of Director of Ship
Design. After selection to Flag rank, he was chosen as one of the Navy's first Project
Managers. This project led the design of the Fast Deployment Logistics ship, which
portended today's Rapid Deployment Force. In its design, Admiral Sonenshein successfully
pioneered a new approach which quantified for the first time, top level mission
requirements and translated them into ship design parameters to achieve the optimum
functional performance.

At the peak of hostilities in Southeast Asia, a period marked by tremendous strain on
material, personnel and time resources, Admiral Sonenshein was selected to be Commander,
Naval Ship Systems Command.

After his retirement in 1974, Sonenshein lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He moved to Moraga,
California less than a decade later and became assistant to the president of Global Marine
Development, Inc., in Newport Beach, California. In 1982, he received the American Society
of Naval Engineers' Harold E. Saunders Award, which honors """"an individual whose reputation
in naval engineering spans a long career of notable achievement and influence."""" In 1983,
he was a member of the Marine Board of the Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems
of the National Research Council. During his tenure, the board produced a report,
""""Criteria for the Depths of Dredged Navigational Channels.""""

On July 1, 1984, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to a two-year term as one of
eight members of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere. The Reagan
Administration's choices for the panel membership drew criticism from environmentalists,
who noted that it included no atmospheric scientists.

One of the committee's more controversial reports during his tenure suggested that U.S.
shipyards be allowed to go out of business rather than be propped up by government
subsidy. The report, released July 16, 1985, concluded that the country's shipyard
capacity is """"considerably greater"""" than would be required in a major conventional war.
Using classified Pentagon studies, the report concluded that shipyards could expand
production by 3 1/2 to six times, providing all the new ships that would be needed. """"Look
at England in the Falklands"""", Sonenshein told the Washington Post. """"In less than two
months, they were able to modify and convert some 50 of their merchant ships that were
then used for naval operations...Sure, it's always better to have more shipyards and more
merchant ships to give you a margin of safety. But the hard question is, are you going to
pay for it? I wouldn't pay for any more than we now have."""" [1]

Sonenshein died at Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael, California, aged 85. He was buried at
Oakmont Cemetery in Lafayette, California.

He is survived by a daughter, Carol Sonenshein Manashil, a son, William Sonenshein and
three grandchildren: Sarah Irving, Thomas Allen King and Elizabeth Manashil.

Biased?
I am curious as to why it would seem that the U.S was singled out for a complete page on national racism? - I have yet to find a page dedicated to racism in other countries such as Africa, Britain, Mexico, Brazil, Iran, etc etc. 

Why is it that a whole page is dedicated to racism in the U.S as if it is/was the only country to marginalize persons by race?

I believe that this page should be merged into a general page of world racism, or just be deleted altogether, it's a little more than """"biased"""" in my opinion.  

See Racism by country. We deal with the """"bias"""" of missing articles on Wikipedia by writing new articles. See WP:CSB if you want to help provide a more global view. By the way, people who say Africa is a country might raise a few hackles among other editors writing about racism. 

The situation in the United States is unique in terms of its special brand of racism, the completeness of the...the campaign against Native Americans, the special circumstances surrounding the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the particularities of this version of slavery, the premises and outcome of the Civil War, and especially the complex time period following emancipation. This period is fairly unique in many ways, including but not limited to the fact that a bifurcated society developed with the former slave class developing in parallel alongside the former slave-owning class with visible distinctions in terms of melanin and linguistic distinctions resulting from the circumstances of the previous centuries, the long process of segregation, Jim Crow, the rise of African-American influence on mainstream American culture, KKK, White Citizens Councils and lynchings, and the long drive for the abolition of Jim Crow and the securing of the right to vote not only on paper but in practice, and the fact that many of the goals have been achieved, though how thorough this achievement has been is still a topic of debate. Most historical precedents result in one race wiping out the other, either by killing or displacement. To merge this article would be like merging an article on the Second world War into a general article on War, or merging the article on Homo Sapiens into an article on mammals. It makes no sense.
The truth hurts, but it's still the truth. This is a website for facts.

I see where you hesitated with the ellipsis.  The American campaign against the Natives involved such things as biological warfare, enslavement, mass rape, forced migration, and ordinary massacres. It was nothing less then genocide.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.132.84.67   """,0

WhoMe's new introduction

After the last few days many of us from both sides of the fence had worked out an informative introduction that was both clear and covered the main points. Most importantly it described the view of the official body for naming astronomical nomenclature and combined both their working definition for extrasolar planets and their more recent definition for out own solar system in a clear fashion to inform people in the opening paragraph. The new intro is junk. Please can we amend this without having an edit war.  

Having looked at the lastest changes/reverts/whatever made by yourself, I find the recent changes to be much clearer than when I originally started discussing this controversy.  Despite many objections on both sides, the article is much clearer.  I'm assuming here that what is currently is what you want the article to look like.  I certainly won't start an edit war over it! I've never participated in an edit war and I don't intend to start now. —  (comment)  

Actually, I would have preferred just listing """"A planet is officially defined as..."""" but now it has been amended so:
a) there are links a the naming dispute both in the first sentence as well as the sandbox
b) it is not listed as the official definition, just as a definition by the IAU
c) it is noted that this is recent and also that there were alternate lists before this
d) there is link to the astrology article that defines planet differently
e) there is a quantifier to say it may not be universally accepted.
I think not to address the IAU definition in the introduction is more POV than including it, giving its significance. We have already given it far less credit than all reports in the mainstream and scientific media.  

Well at least one entry (d) does not need to be there.  I added it to the disambiguation page, so that should be sufficient.  There is no need to list it on this page explicitly. —  (comment)  

I felt that seeing that the astrology term described many of the same objects as the astronomy term there should be a direct link, especially given the dispute over Pluto, which, as you rightly pointed out, will still be counted by many astronomers. However, if you still feel it should be taken out I won't object. And for the record, despite the initial clash of heads I've enjoyed working with you on this and you have persuaded me to be a lot closer to your view. Thanks.  

I'm not terribly concerned about the astrology link, one way or another.  It isn't intrusive.  As for this discussion, I really havn't even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word """"official"""", since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the """"official scientific body"""", because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for """"unofficial cultural definitions"""", such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put """"Definition"""" and """"Disagreement"""" under the main heading of """"Etymology"""".  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. —  (comment)

It is in my opinion that until seperate pages are created for Third, Second and First generation fighter jets then I don't really think the addition of one aircraft will really cause a lot of problem until such action is undertaken. Especially given that pretty much every single jet fighter is already on the list. The days of where nearly every country could create their own fighter like in WWII are long gone.

Note

Dear Meanfrank, Wikipedia is all about civil communication with your fellow editors. There are many editors who would go out of the way to assist you, provided you talk to them in a nice and civil manner, keeping a positive and pleasurable attitude at the top of your priority list. Believe it or not, two of the editors who're interacting with you (OrangeMike and Fuhghettaboutit) are some of the most proactive and supportive editors I have seen. It's a good faith advice, try and maintain a good attitude in discussing proactively.

Having said that, let me guide you to a few links that might interest you in understanding how contents can be included on Wikipedia. Do kindly read the following pages:

What are meant by """"reliable sources"""" on Wikipedia and why only those statements that are backed by reliable sources are allowed to be on Wikipedia

Why only """"Verifiable"""" data and statements are allowed to be on Wikipedia

How does one """"cite"""" online sources or offline sources to ensure that statements remain on Wikipedia.

Please feel free to take help from me, or from any of the editors here. They all are eager to help you.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for web content.

8451,"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!! They seem to be trying to copy George BUsh with the creation of Schengen. Fuck you EU government dickheads, we ESL teachers all hate you!!!!!!!  You ruined our jobs, our profession.

Relation with iconoclasm

""""The specific motivation for the rush of inspired destruction of Greek and Roman sculpture unleashed at the end of the 4th century, as soon as Christianity was in secure control, is revealed here: the images were inhabited by demons. As in all such destruction, the faces were especially attacked, literally """"defaced.""""[citation needed]""""
This comment is unsubstantiated and seems odd, particularily the phrase """"is revealed here"""". Sounds like original research at best. I've never heard of any justification for this viewpoint. Surely the reason for the iconoclasm was the destruction of all traces of the previous religion? Unless proof of this can be found, I think this piece of Dan Brown-calibre historical guesswork can be removed.

3488,"""

, please, just think about what you're saying here. Let's take this by the numbers:

 Firstly, quite frankly, I am dissappointed that you saw no reason to act in the face of the diffs and information I posted at User talk:Black Kite . Your suggestion that HighKing should """"step back from this type of edit"""" is, quite frankly, going to be ignored, again, as his edits on The Automobile Association showed. His admission that he has a problem sounds depressingly familiar. After 5 years of being unable to contain this problem himself, and in the face of overwhelming evidence yet again in this case that it still exists, then coming as it did off the back of yet more of the usual erroneous defences, duplicitous denials and improper deflections, is surely wholly unsatisfactory.
 's close was both abusive and counter-productive. He closed a perfectly valid complaint, based on completely irrelevant reasons, namely my 'status' (further below, and on his talk page). If I had not pressed him about it on his talk page, he wouldn't have even bothered to notify you about it, and you would never have even heard about 's actions at The Automobile Association.
 Your charge of harassment is frankly ridiculous - all I have done with this account is make factual statements about HighKing's current and past behaviour, which you yourself have just repeated today, is still problematic. I am obviously not the IP user he was edit warring with, I never engaged with HighKing, I never reverted HighKing, I never threatened or personally attacked HighKing. All I did was comment on the situation in a factual manner, in the hope other admins would take action in your absence. If me making this sort of contribution spoils HighKing's enjoyment of Wikipedia, who the hell cares, quite frankly? It's simply not harassment. If HighKing was to turn into a model editor tomorrow, then he'd never hear me talking about him ever again. That's not harassment, it's practically the job description of a Wikipedia admin!
 Your block for evading scrutiny - it is entirely pointless. Enforcement of WP:SOCK long ago stopped being about what's good for Wikipedia in many instances, as this block shows. Whatever my history, whether this is a legitimate or illegitimate alternate account, whether I'm blocked or banned, whatever, there isn't a single thing that I could possibly be hiding that would make the edits this account performed look any less valid to an outside observer. Nothing that might be or could be revealed about me, would change their meaning or relevance, and it certainly wouldn't make them any (more) true. The idea that only established can be implicitly trusted to tell the truth on Wikipedia strikes me as extremely dangerous, a view no admin should be seen within a hundred miles of holding, let alone repeating.
 Taking 3 & 4 together, there was absolutely no preventative purpose to this block, and so, it it is entirely without grounds in basic policy. And on the issue of basic points of policy with regard both the socking and harassment charges - you don't even know for sure if this is an illegitimate sock. You don't know if I have a regular account, or if I'm blocked or banned. You're just guessing. For all you know, I might be using an undeclared alternate account because I myself might have previously been the victim of harassment from HighKing, and so I would have a perfectly legitimate reason to hide what my 'regular account' is when commenting on him in future. And given the fact that, as this block shows, being critical of HighKing is seemingly enough to get someone tarred with a charge of conducting a """"long term campaign of harassment"""" without any actual evidence whatsoever, then it would be entirely understanable if an editor in good standing would not want to expose their main account to that sort of smear, as the price of simply commenting on HighKing.
 To expand on the socking issue - rather than being an """"inappropriate"""" use of a sock, when it comes to HighKing, I think its self evident given his past, using a sock when commenting on his behaviour at a venue like ANI is highly appropriate, as it removes his ability to do what he has often done in those situations, namely trying to deflect attention from his own behaviour by talking about what the people reporting him have done, whether it is even relevant or not, and indeed, whether it is even true or not (his habit for example of makin",0

 Temple of Diana 

Quote from """"Pre-Norman cathedral"""" section: """"Geoffrey of Monmouth claimed that the cathedral had been built on the site of a temple dedicated to the goddess Diana, in alignment with the Apollo temple that he imagined once stood at Westminster..."""".

Nonsense - Geoffrey did NOT make such a claim. The idea that (following the persecution of Christians by Diocletian) Apollo was worshipped at Westminster and Diana in London comes from the history of Westminster Abbey by John Flete, 15th-century monk of Westminster - and he didn't say that Diana was worshipped on the site of St Paul's. That comes from William Camden's Britannia, published in 1586. Camden puts forward the theory that a Roman Temple of Diana had once stood on the site of St Paul's. His evidence is not accepted by modern archaeologists. 

And if the """"in alignment with"""" phrase actually means what it says, one can only respond that a straight line can indeed be drawn between any two points!

Since the sentence about Geoffrey of Monmouth is unreferenced and unverifiable (as well as untrue) I'm simply going to delete it pro tem - unless someone can provide the essential reference to a verifiable source. However, since the """"Temple of Diana"""" story still resurfaces occasionally (along with the """"megalithic stone circle""""!) it will be worth reintroducing it at some point, correctly attributed and with proper references.  -   """,0

The Liberal Democrats do not have a hope in NW Hants even if they have a good candidate. In this constituency unemployment is very low, and home ownership is high, all of which helps Labour and the Conservatives who were the top two parties in the constituency in 2001, both exhibiting positive swings while the Lib Dems lost votes. This is an obvious Tory hold. Nevertheless, good luck Mr Tod. Maybe you'll get to fight for a different constituency in 2010, but by that time the Lib Dems will probably have changed their views on almost everything anyway.

 Removed POV 

I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV. Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead. The following has been removed from the article.

""""Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation.  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money. Chicago Times, March 6, 1875.  """"He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred,"""" a New England politician wrote his brother. Henry F. French to Benjamin B. French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B. French Papers, Library of Congress.

""""Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmatic.""""Liberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses.''""""

Hi RetroS1mone. Thanks for coming here to reply to Guido - it's no problem at all, especially when I'm not around. I replied to Guido above about the 3RR block. If Guido does take my advice to work on that table in his userspace, would you give him the time to marshall his arguments and listen to what he has to say? I know he does have COI with the activist organisation, but while strongly discouraged it is not forbidden to edit if you have a COI. See WP:COI and also Wikipedia:Suggestions for COI compliance. Me personally, I would prefer Guido edited chess articles and only participated on the talk pages of CFS/ME pages (or worked on the article about CFS activism that has been suggested). Oh, and you are quite right about the forum-shopping. Guido, if you have a complaint about conduct on those articles, you will need to find another admin and not come to my talk page. I've commented on the talk pages of some of these articles with suggestions about the content, and (for me) that makes me too involved as an editor to use my admin tools in relation to those articles. RetroS1mone, speaking as an editor and not an admin, I would advise you not to say things in edit summaries like """"tendentious editor with strong COI POV"""". The reason being that edit summaries are permanent records, and if you say something incorrect, you can't retract it. It is best to keep edit summaries focused on describing the content (not the editors) and then to say """"see talk"""" if you want to go into more detail. That way, if you are wrong, you can retract and apologise later. For the record, I think you are mostly right here (though I would have phrased it more diplomatically), but I hope you see my point about the difference between saying something in an edit summary and saying something on a talk page.

 Edit request from Maksudfsa10, 9 March 2011 

Just a minor edit. I've added Azerbaijanis to the list that describes turks (in the first paragraph) as we are the second largest turkic ethnic group.

  

The Turks (or Turkics) are peoples residing in northern, central and western Asia, Mongolia, southern Siberia and northwestern China and parts of eastern Europe. They speak languages belonging to the Turkic language family.Turkic people, Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition, 2010 They share, to varying degrees, certain cultural traits and historical backgrounds. The term Turkic represents a broad ethno-linguistic group of people including existing societies such as the  Azerbaijanis, Chuvashes, Kazakhs, Tatars, Kyrgyzs, Turkish, Turkmen, Uyghur, Uzbeks, Bashkirs, Qashqai, Gagauzs, Yakuts, Crimean Karaites, Krymchaks, Karakalpaks, Karachays, Nogais and as well as past civilizations such as the  Kumans, Kipchaks, Avars, Turgeshs, Seljuks, Khazars, Ottomans, Mamluks, Timurids, and possibly the Xiongnu and Huns.""""Timur"""", The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001–05, Columbia University Press.Encyclopaedia Britannica article: Consolidation & expansion of the Indo-Timurids, Online Edition, 2007.""",0

Plot does NOT mean talking about the movie's trailer or what genre the movie it is. A plot is a SUMMARY of the movie.

Read what's in the Plot section of """"solaris"""" right now you fucking retard and tell me if it really belongs under the section plot... or any other section. It looks more like trivial facts which are unsupported and should be DELETED as per wiki regulations.
 

Here's an example, dumb fuck, from the solaris wiki page:

""""The film essentially ignores the planet which only serves as an anonymous backdrop, in contrast to Lem's novel which discusses at length the mysterious phenomena on its surface and the futile human attempts to understand them.""""

That is NOT neutrality and has NOTHING to do with the plot.

What do you call everything you do FeloniousMonk? That is, if it's not a political campaign on your part, what is? The POV campaigning I see here is a radical left-wing campaign on your part. My only goal is to bring things into balance here on Wikipedia because most outsiders regard it as highly unreliable and biased. Why don't readers have the right to know the type of group CRESP is ideologically speaking and who they associate with?

What's the problem with showing the political biases of groups you support, say compared with your baseless accusation that people like Paul Weyrich or James Dobson want to impose Old Testament law upon the United States? I thought that if something was factual and verifiable, it was kosher. That's what you told me about TheocracyWatch. If Paul's a theocrat, then maybe you could find a first-hand reference of the kind I provided. Are you not aware that United for Peace and Justice was founded by the Communist Party USA and a number of Marxist groups, and according  to the Commmunist Party USA Web site Joelle Fishman an officer of the CPUSA is a member of the steering committee? Tell me, why are you so worried about people knowing that CRESP belongs to an organization populated by the Ruckus Society, CodePink and the Communist Party USA?
The vast majority of the UNFPJ's members are pretty extreme on the Left side of the spectrum. The important thing about UNFPJ is who founded it.
For me to a belong to a group on the right akin to the UNFPJ, it would be akin to belonging to a group founded or run by the Nazis. Are you afraid of the truth?

Deal with the substance here, not my personality, or your efforts to railroad me with a phony RfC signed by your friends. Let's stop applying the rules differently when they make you uncomfortable. 

Why is it poisoning the well to point out the fact CRESP is involved with a pretty radical group? Are you afraid of the truth? NPOV doesn't mean just FeloniousMonk's point of view. I'm for balance, and diversity of opinions, expressed fairly is a good idea, don't you think?

TheocracyWatch can't prove it's claims, but I can prove these.
 
There's nothing for me to learn from the RfC except some people are afraid of having their worldviews challenged, or from being restrained from pressing their anti-religious political agendas. If you don't like my """"POV campaigning,"""" then why do you do it yourself? 

What do you call your series of hit pieces on the Christian Right about the supposed threat of """"Dominionism,"""" if it's not POV campaigning? Why is it every article you have posted on politics or religion expresses a Left of center POV? If I missed one, show me. I guess that's not POV campaigning, right?

Just in case you hadn't noticed, 49 of the 50 states say God is the ultimate authority, and it's spelled out in their constitutions.

Firtsly I want to make it clear there was no real proof at all, the """"proof"""" provided were: a comparison of Ahmadinejad's 2005 first round results per province (in which 7 major candidates competed and none had a majority) with his 2009 results per province, which ofcourse showed and increase for Ahmadinejad votes everywhere and than the claim that this should be impossible, which """"proves"""" Mousavi won. A claim by Mousavi office that the """"actual results"""" leaked and showed him with 19 milion votes and Ahmadinejad with only 5 milion votes which contradicts the green movement's claims that the eelection results weren't counted at all, because the results were in (supposedly) much to quickly, which is their other """"major proof"""" that the results were rigged. Another """"proof"""" is the myth of """"all Azeris would automaticly vote for Mousavi, disregaring all politics and voting purely on ethnic basis"""" (which should """"prove"""" that the election was rigged as Ahmadinejad won in Tabriz), but at the same time the Persians are not gonna vote ethnicly for some reason unknown to us, infact they were all gonna vote for Mousavi the non-Persian. Other than these flawed theories presented by the Green movement you've got a few claims by them that anonymous government workers have admitted the election was rigged, the problem being that none of this can ever ben confirmed and the assumption that the fact that 100,000 people demonstrated in a city of 14,000,000 (metropolian area) - although nowhere else in the country the Greens could get over 1000 people - should make everyone believe that it is sooo obviously clear tha a vast majority of Iran's 74 milion people support this man. And all of these weak claims are mentioned throughout all articles related (and even articles hardly related) to the elections and/or green movement. Now if this is the only """"proof"""" they have (which it is), why would pro-American governments and the media in their country's take it all so seriously? Simple, politics are politics. There has been a smear-campaign against Ahmadinejad, in western media ever since he got in power and against Iran ever since the revolution, because the Iranian politics do not coincide with American geo-strategic interests. Why do you think their camera crews prior to the elections only interviewed university students in Northern Tehran which spoke fluent English, while no other city, region or population group's views were ever shown on American news? Because they wanted to create an image that Mousavi is more populair, while infact he wasn't, as the fully legitimate results show.

2)  A few of the entries DO need citations, but links to other Wikipedia articles ARE the citations. Do you even remotely understand the concept of BRANCHING?

One of the reasons the article is being flagged for being too big is that people aren't BRANCHING to other links where there are CITATIONS supporting THOSE PARTICULAR POSITIONS. One DOESN'T HAVE TO RE-INVENT THE LIGHTBULB everytime one needs a new lightbulb.

2) I fixed the broken link. And if you had bothered to READ the sermon/discussion between Branham and Billy Gramham, you would have found in paragraph 40 this """"trinities"""" statement...

40 Jesus come three times. He came the first time to redeem His Church. He comes the second time to receive His Church. He comes the third time with His Church. EVERYTHING IN THE BIBLE TRAVELS IN TRINITIES, THREES, but all in one Christ. He... Remember, the first time to redeem His Church, the second time to receive His Church, the third time with His Church, as King and Queen.
Now, but on His first coming, we'll speak of just a little bit, and then on His being here; and then on His second coming; on Hisand then on the third time; if the Lord willing.

(And if I could figure out a way to link directly to that paragraph, I would.)

The problem with Branham's statement is that not every triunism is a """"trinity,"""" which is a confusion of terms.

Scholars ALSO use the term """"typology,"""" but usually only in twos.

I'll add more references from the THOUSANDS of them out there later.

3) You demonstrate your ignorance of the Bible and Jewish traditions: Citing that John said Jesus """"went up to the feast of the Dedication which is held in the winter,"""" i.e. HANUKKAH, is NOT """"original research."""" ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE BIBLE (which you don't) KNOWS that """"the feast of the dedication that is held in the winter IS HANUKKAH. And you DON'T NEED CITATIONS to CITE A STATEMENT OF FACT (especially when there is a link to the """"Hanukkah"""" page).

4) Citing that John spoke five kingdoms that """"were,"""" one that """"is,"""" etc. is ALSO A STATEMENT OF FACT. And the concept of TRIUNISM/TRINITIES/TYPOLOGY is ALL OVER CHRISTIAN LITERATURE.

That article is ok I guess, the Androgyny section could use a better explanation, but meh. I dumped some stuff into the section about docking to dead ships/stations, cause it was just so crap and WRONG. Needs some polish now, as I didn't delete anything, just added a nice read which could be trimmed, but that article is very short and could use some meat on it's bones. Anyhow """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future"""" still isn't too bad because it's correct. Even if the docking adapters never existed in the first place, the statement is still true. Even if there was no USOS, the statement is still true. You see what I mean ? It could happen, doesn't mean it will, it doesn't rule out or rule in any possibilities, sure we could endlessly qualify it like """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future, so long as the station is not deorbited first, or has it's budget cut, or the APAS's are covered, mangled, sold, ejected, stolen by Ivan Ivanovich, america doesn't declare war on china, ESA doesn't declare martial law on columbus"""" and so forth. It's just that it's a correct statement as is, plus, short and sweet. I'm very happy that what you are saying is correct, and belongs somewhere with other future maybe plans, however it has little to do with china because the docking is already tenuous at best, and so not going to happen in the next few years, and if it does, they will need to prepare anyway. So where is the article that outlines a hypothetical docking to the ISS to tell us where it is or isn't ? It's pretty much all speculation and too far out on a limb to outline such hypothetical within the China section, better to just mention the hypothetical possibility of docking as a point of interest and move on with the now and is. The location of the hypothetical docking would be subject to political pressures, like if ESA and RSA forced america to agree, by no longer provisioning services like transport, then it would be ROS docking, but if the US and China made up it would be an american module docking, and so forth, hardware would be provisioned to reflect the nature of the political decision.

Check it out. I was trying to find an image for Tropical Depression One in 1988, when I came across this, which looks like a well-organized unclassified storm just off of North Carolina. On May 26 a cold front extended across the western Atlantic Ocean. The next day, a circulation developed to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, with much of its convection sheared to the northeast; at the time, it might have still been frontal. Tracking to the northeast, by early the next day the center became more involved with the convection, though only based on interpolation from IR. By the time of the first visible image, it was just off of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, possibly extratropical or subtropical, based on the (presumably) cold air being entrained. Convection deepened, and three hours later it looked tropical, which is where I found the image. Unfortunately, there's no more Atlantic visible images after that due to an error. Nilfanion found this visible satellite image, meaning it must not have been very deep. Here's another, and here's a small one. Verdict?

14:58, 21 September 2009 Kelly A. Siebecke (talk | contribs) (10,340 bytes) (the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them, removing them, or exaggerating them - edit reverted) 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke.
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous, removed undue repetition, I exaggerated nothing.
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kelly's talk page. This is simply untrue. Her only warning was not to TALK (what are talk pages for ?)
A little history: I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley. My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake. After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor, I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral. They accepted that.I am not a wide-eyed fan or close friend. We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. 
In the chat room, I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue. I didn't really take it seriously. As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. 
In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine. That is just ludicrous. I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent. AS the """"great"""" philosopher Rodney King said """"why can't everybody just be nice? ;-) I work with Karel. I know the good the bad and the ugly, and will record such as long it is truthful and factual.
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself. What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate. Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it. Please help. I am a nice lady with a little temper. My grandchildren think I am awesome. I am funny, I have something to contribute. I was Valedictorian at age 42. Work with me please. I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone. I was wrong.

1555,"Gross misinformation
Look:
I don't care where you took this chart from, remember well: Bulgarian has six vowels, SIX, SIX, SIX and NOT eight. There are four other allophones (two between a and @ and two between o and u), which appear in unstressed syllables depending on the position of the unstressed syllable to the stressed syllable within a certain word. If you are posting also allophones and not only phonemes (the reasonable question is why you are doing this but we'll deal with this some other time), then the vowel chart should include all ten of them and not only eight with information which is an allophone and which is a phoneme. But you don't know that, do you?

Then we get to another reasonable question: why do you think that you can erase the whole vowel section with the vowel descriptions? Ha? 

So: you post a chart which is WRONG and then you erase a section which is RIGHT. What the hell are you doing? I am getting tired of non-experts who read something somewhere and then come and try to wreak havoc on articles which they understand nothing about. A couple of months ago, one user was trying to change the article Bulgaria because he had read that the Bulgarians were descendants of the Shumers. In two words, your edit is pretty much of the same value and worth. For the phonetics section here, I've used the Routledge compendium on Slavic languages (1991) and the newest Bulgarian edition of New Bulgarian - phonetics, grammar and syntax. Please, consult any book on Bulgarian phonetics before you come again with this vowel chart.",0

 Removal of poorly sourced claims about vegetarianism 

The article currently says, 
The Economist in an article writes that some Uruguayans see him as """"a roly-poly former guerrilla who grows flowers on a small farm and swears by vegetarianism"""", but he is not vegetarian.

The source that claims Mujica is not a vegetarian is dubious; it appears to be an opinion piece by someone who opposes the president's lifestyle. The claim contradicts statements made in the article's more neutral sources, including the BBC source, which calls him """"the vegetarian Mujica"""". Following the usage guidelines for biographies of living persons, I've removed this claim.

E.g. 
My use of wikipedia being my *reading* use, as is made clear by the statement """"those orange banners are annoying."""" I didn't evade the block until such point when I thought it had been communicated that editing under a different IP wouldn't be considered evasion. As User:Dennis Brown pointed out to me, IP addresses aren't humans; they're more akin to telephone numbers. It follows that a block applied to a telephone number applies to that telephone number. If the intention was to stop me, personally, from editing Wikipedia, shouldn't it have been a ban? (Also, you must be aware that statements like """"to twist logic in your defense"""" fail to AGF.)
At this point, I'm pretty sure that everyone has taken it as granted that I'm being deceptive simply by choosing not to register for an account. If that's the case, this really doesn't seem like the encyclopedia that anyone is encouraged to edit boldly. Also, you're misconstruing what I admitted (see above.)

Writing new guidelines that general folks understand
18-July-2009: These recent events have just re-confirmed what I've been telling people for years: Wikipedia runs on mobocracy, despite other people claiming (for years), """"No, no, WP decisions are made per logical reasoning, in accordance with written policies"""". Well, actually, that's not how decisions have been made, for several years, as of July 2009. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the wiki-masses, in this attitude, that """"truth"""" is a popularity contest. There can't be a massive, multi-year wiki-cabal, so I suspect these mob-judgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to think.Many school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people. In America, people are not allowed, typically, to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education, where they must pass standards of clear thinking. Not just anyone can sit on the bench, and start making decisions that affect thousands of other people.We have to write reality-based guidelines, with totally obvious examples, so that anyone could understand them. The wiki-masses don't follow concepts such as """"significant coverage"""" in reliable sources: I must conclude the current WP policies are like wiki-calculus for the masses. They cannot calculate wiki-integrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion. Hence, the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editors.So, these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time, re-hashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes. We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed: I don't think there's any other hope. Most people just don't understand the current policy points, no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions. They see """"NOTINHERITED"""" and that's the extend of their reading: 2 words is a policy to them. Perhaps they started to read the policy text (yawn) and re-zoned to the 2 words, period.

To be readable, we must list obvious examples, such as the one-event R.M.S. Titanic generating """"50"""" notables. Plus, those examples must be listed in easy-to-read essays (no consensus required), so when we put """"WP:BIGEVENT"""" they know that, historically, big single events have generated numerous notables (e.g.: Lee Harvey Oswald & Jack Ruby in JFK assassination; Charles Manson & Manson family in Sharon Tate/etc. murders). It's the only way to defeat the notion that exceptions, to the intricate policies, must be determined by intense debates of popularity votes. No, instead, big-event notability can be explained by a simple essay of examples. We need those policy essays to shift the mass voting. -  """,0

 3RR warning 

Three times today (28 Oct.) you have reverted the """"sinusoids"""" language to your preferred """"trigonometric functions"""" language, as I've tried various things to explain, reference, talk about it, etc.  Please engage rather than just reverting.  If you revert again, I'll report you for 3RR violation again.  

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis). But I cited 2 references that literally say """"trigonometric functions"""", while your references all refer to another method (Fourier analysis) you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter, though it is obvious they do not (in your mind, as you claimed it explicitly, Fourier analysis is still the same as least-squares spectral analysis, which is obviously a nonsense because WP has two completely separate articles both featured on WP main page btw).  So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around. Just like so many editors noted (everyone just look at Dicklyon’s talk page) that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far. You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself. """"Sinusoids"""" is another result of your imagination as NO REFERENCE ON LSSA EVER MENTIONS IT, so it is not a reversal to remove your ignorance, cleaning your shit is what it is.  """,1

The reason we have cited the report regarding the Bangladeshi Law Ministers comments about Drishtipat's partiality toward the Awami League is because Drishtipat themselves [] put the Law Ministers comments and their response together under the heading ' Drishtipat response to the law minister's allegation' on their site. If the organisation itself felt criticised and responded, then it is hardly controversial to presume that it was Drishtipat that the Law Minister was talking about. I'm sure Drishtipat knew their own position and intentions better than the moderator (Ragib) on Wikipedia!

Besides in Bangali politikospeak, the governing party of the day rarely criticises an opponent by name. For example, when the BNP were in power, they would use oblique language like 'a certain party is causing violence in Bangladesh' with reference to hartals. Everyone would read between the lines and know that they are criticising their main opponents the Awami League. It's hardly rocket science. 

It is therefore reasonable as a citation of the governments position and the Law Minister also expanded on the reasons eg. partisan reporting re: government achievements.",0

He is a Jewish American, Gabriel. And he is using his little position as an admin to CENSOR the facts here to protect his zionist beliefs!

That is NOT RIGHT AND YOU KNOW THAT! 

The section I edited had to do with Hollywood and its treatment towards Iranians in the media and on screen.

All I did was bring forth WHY they do what they do. 
1) I used an LA TIMES column to back my information up.
2) I included names, their organizations, and a link!

There was NOTHING opinionated about it. I simply included the fact that Hollywood movie giants are all Jewish and is the cause for the bias that Hollywood portrays towards the enemies of zionist principles.

How can this fool be allowed to label it as an opinion?!? Please try and see where I am coming from. I am not even Iranian, im not even RELIGIOUS! Im a completely unbiased.

Is this person cuchullian a member of the Klu Klux Klan or the reincarnation of some murderous crusader era Jesuit? Hard to believe such fanatic people exist even in 21st century.All his edits point to white supremacist thinking. The opinion of one guy who makes a living out of serving the Vatican- """"Vadakekkara"""" is quoted all around the article as something authentic. Nobody has heard of his name as a historian.
Note that cuchullian is quoting records of """"Vatican"""" and """"goa""""- both terms which are associated with murder, genocide and inquisitions among the Saint Thomas Christians.

Using Vatican sources and goan archives made during the Inquisitions by fanatic western Jesuit priests to to depict the history of Saint Thomas Christians is really deplorable. This person seems hell bent on using wikipedia as a means to insult people and to turn this encyclopaedia as some sort of an inquisition device.

A parallel to the massacre of history made here would be akin to using Nazi archives to write an article on the history of Israel and the Exodus. Fanatics like cuchullian belong in the medieval era. His pro-vatican edits can be seen if you refer the edits hes made. A guy with a hate agenda.

To Derild4921 and Sadads: If your main dispute is the sourcing with the original article then why did you not contact me, as I could have provided the additional source material - you can see from my contributions I just author Tunnels books on here. As I said above all the content of the original article is completely accurate and can be verified. I have provided a number of source links to justify that. Should I need more, no problem just advise me. As far as I can see I did broadly meet the Notability standards. This may not be in the GA format that you are looking for, but as Wikipedia content relies on volunteers passionate about their article subject, I feel you should be more supportive. As I confirmed above it was me who asked for the reassessment, only at that stage, a few days ago, did you offer to 'help' improve my article. The new article you created in your Sandbox, then only remains there for 1 day before you either lose the content or publish it - hardly enough time for me to discuss my objections about your new proposal to remove my article. To replace my article when you have not even finished reading Tunnels is ridiculous - surely any author on Wikipedia should at least have read the novel first, not sure how that can meet your verifiable Notability standards! That aside I have already correctly embarrassing errors concerning incorrect publishing dates and versions, wrong character and place names like Stynx and Hightail (not a one off). Others that come to mind include: The official publication date for the US Tunnels was January 2008 - it might have been that copies were available on Amazon earlier than that date, but that often happens in the UK and US. Nearly all territories have gone on to publish Deeper, and only a handful haven't yet published Freefall (mainly due to their own financial difficulties, and not because the performance of the series hasn't merited it!) - you can check this on the publishers website http://www.doublecluck.com/rights. The authors changed the title with Barry Cunningham - this article makes it sound as though he did it off his own back! There are two versions of the audiobook in the UK (the Davenport one is abridged), and also the American and German unabridged versions. Chester isn't """"about to killed"""" under SETTING - he is sentenced to go into the Interior! The Plot emphasis is all wrong and does not give a true insight into the overall storyline. The Setting and Plot areas you have changed are so badly written - and I am well aware of my own average writing abilities, but in comparison this new version lacks significant maturity. References to the Highfield Mole are confusing. Barry is now Barry Cunningham OBE, and there's no question that he signed JK Rowling for her first two Harry Potter books whilst he was employed by Bloomsbury. I would like my article reinstated and with your expert help and support I would like to improve and expand my sources, and thus improve my own knowledge of Wikipedia article standards. My priority is not, however, achieving GA status at the expense of diminished quality or informative reading. I do have the support of the UK fansite team on this. The authors have often been kind enough to verify and supply content for my article. Following my notification about your changes, they have emailed me their confirmation that they would also like to see the original version restored. I await your response. Thanks (  )""",0

Okay, so my musical taste is all over the place, and it would take me a while to find 10 classic rock songs I'd like the best.

This article suggests that using """"bitch"""" to describe a young woman is exclusive to hip hop culture. This is not the case. This is THE prominent term to describe a woman in the African-American community. How many black people do you know who actually call a woman a woman? None. They all say """"bitch"""" as in """"Ah fucked dis bitch las' naht nigga. She wa' FAAAHN."""" Black people will NEVER say """"woman"""" because it is ingrained in their culture to be derogatory towards women! THAT is why it is used in hip hop, because that is black entertainment. Misogyny is a crucial element of African0American culture and this is why black people throw around the word """"bitch"""" as a synonym for """"woman"""". It's the same way how black people never call a song a """"song"""" they will always call it a """"track"""" and if you call it a song the black people will think you're a """"square"""" ad """"not hip.""""

 WW2 casualties 

I think some more narrative prose is a good idea. The main tables should still be there for easy lookup, but the topic is complex, often controversial, and different sources have different numbers. And all this could/should be elaborated on and explained in the article, yes. Many people will come to the page with numbers on their """"own"""" country that they have learned or read, and we should have some text explaining more thorowly what the numbers we list include. And that's probably best done outside tables and in addition to just simple footnotes.

Maybe we could also have separate casuality sections for the different (major) countries, with text and tables where there could be made room for lower and upper bounds on numbers and space for citing different sources and their numbers. Not so much that I expect you to find and look up every different estimate, but there are many people editing and there could be a value in having room for those comming here later with different sources to add to the information. I don't know.

But I really like your work so far. It was about time that we got some well-sourced numbers in this article. Well done!  """,0

2265,"Nonsense. The Syrian army committed 1,500 men. They were wholly unprepared for the war, having received notice that they were to fight just a few days before the 15th of May. Their logistics were poor - they had handed over a part of their munition reserves to the Arab Salvation Army, and given its scarcity of war matériel had to husband what was left. Its knowledge of the theatre of war where it was to conduct operations was minimal. It took then almost a week to get their tanks over the Jordan. Their first advance was roundly defeated, with heavy losses. On the 18th under Husni Zaim they attacked and took Samakh, south of Tiberias, only to lose it in three days after an Israeli-kibbutznik counter attack. This massive army 'with artillary, tanks, (armed?)armoured cars and airforce stocked with Harvards, (not Harvard-armed aircraft!!, which is a brilliantly comical image)' took 4 days, involving almost all that the Syrian army could muster, to capture a little  moshava like Mishmar HaYarden, with its 20 local guards (Tal p.261) which had to fight on its own, without IDF assistance.
Secondly, you really should stop this nonsense about RS bias. Morris is biased against the Palestinian/Arab side, anyone can see that, but he is eminently good on the facts. Laurens is perhaps the most neutral of all, but he gives the Arab version a much more intelligent coverage than others. Morris, Tal, Gelber, Laurens are all RS, and that's all that counts. One cannot challenge one of them, as if the others were somehow engaged in 'neutral' coverage.",0

I'm not sure where you're located or what you know about the history of the Pacific Northwest, or how much of the particular special lexicon around here you  may be aware of.  But let me tell you this, really loud and clear -= a certain warm wet southwesterly, typically days in duration, is called a Chinook by fishermen, sailors, ferry crews, loggers and yes the weathermen, who use the term as part of the loca argot in the same way they commonly use """"out on the chuck"""" meaning """"out on the water"""" (and that's not in Canadian meteorologic usages either).  The media in this case are not incorrect, but rather using the existing local tgerminology, often kinda proudly (as also with the saltchuck/chuck references); it's not the first time that standard Canadian usages are completely clueless or heedless of British Columbian usage.  It may not in fact be the same wind, there being in the old days no way to call what is now Alberta and let 'em know the tropical air mass was on its way over; all I know is the term IS part of the marine and weather lexicons in BCand, at least, in Whatcom County (where KVOS-TV 12 is, one of the stations who use the term).  As fort the directional thing, it's pretty clear with the Prairie version of the wind that the direction """"from the country ofthe Chinooks"""" IS the origin, especially when you consdier that the fur traders' HQ on the Pacific Slope was in Chinook territory (Fort Vancouver).  The directional thing on the coast is clear if you've ever seen a satellite video of a Chinook, which looks like a big thick band of white cloud streaming in from the general direction of Hawaii, but more specifically SSW even SSWxS, pretty much in a line over the Olympic Peninsula, Greater Victoria, andheadingto into Greater Vancouver from the direction of Tsawswassen, which incientally if you draw back in scale you can see is also roughly the direction of the mouth of hte Coluymbia, i.e. the coujntry of the Chinooks.  But compass-exact directions aren't hte issue, nautical ones are.  And it so happens that Chinooks arriving in Nuu-chahb-nuolth teritory would be coming from the southwest, i.e. around C ape Flattery, but nobody in those days was splitting hairs like you are; they came to use the term Chinook to mean a warm wet wind from that general direction.  The same as Squamish (wind) means a cold, harsh northerly outflow wind, which in the Georgai Strait/nortthern Puget Sound happens to be from the north and the direction of the country of the Skxwu7mesh people at what is now the town of Squamish.  Anyway, aside from all that, I've vgot requests in to Gobal, CBCand other weriters I know of hoping for a proper cite or at least a news item from the vancouver sun.  I don't care about your objections, you're just plain wrong.  And if Canadian meteorologic usage hasnt' included this term, it's their fault, not those of the BC broadcasters who still use it (""""still"""" because it dates back to the old days); it's nopt the first time that Canadian publications of any kiknd have omitted BC  perspectives or simply gotten things all wrong.  And if you ask a Chinook person, you'll find out that the correct pronunciation of the original word IS """"Tshinuk""""; the Albertan prononciation is a frenchified affectation..  """,0

 Message to you, Mr Wales 

There are people I unequivocally despise. They lack morals, character, and honesty. They crush the remaining vestiges of democracy throughout the world. In case you can't tell, I'm talking about Mr. Jimbo Wales here. Let me cut to the chase: Wales says that everyone would be a lot safer if he were to monitor all of our personal communications and financial transactions—even our library records. Why on Earth does Wales need to monitor our library records? In classic sophist fashion, I ask another question in reply: Will Wales's shots to the heart of all that is wholesome buy him his long-sought victory for feckless charlatanism with its showy irreverence and glorification of all that is temeritous? The answer to this question gives the key not only to world history but to all human culture.

The next time someone says that Wales's analects enhance performance standards, productivity, and competitiveness, look that person right in the eye and reply, """"Wales is profoundly hostile to religious tolerance, democracy, and the notion of a secular civil society."""" I plan to hone in on his faults with laser-like precision. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that when Wales says that he has a fearless dedication to reason and truth, that's just a load of spucatum tauri. It is our responsibility to ensure that he doesn't lock all the exits from our present state to the world of constructive reason. I state these facts only to give a bit of personal background as to why I fully intend to stop the Huns at the gate. That's the path that I have chosen. It's definitely not an easy path, but then again, Wales somehow manages to get away with spreading lies (society is supposed to be lenient towards impudent blackguards), distortions (his randy coalition is a respected civil-rights organization), and misplaced idealism (our elected officials should be available for purchase by special-interest groups). However, when I try to respond in kind, I get censored faster than you can say """"predisadvantageously"""".

Carnaptious primates are born, not made. That dictum is as unimpeachable as the """"poeta nascitur, non fit"""" that it echoes and as irreproachable as the brocard that when I hear Wales say that doing the fashionable thing is more important than life or liberty, I have to wonder about him. Is he entirely bitter? Is he simply being mawkish? Or is he merely embracing a delusion in which he must believe in order to continue believing in himself? If you were to ask that of Wales, he'd certainly fling a large barrage of insults in your direction instead of actually addressing the question. He has spent untold hours trying to make empty promises. During that time, did it ever once occur to him that his strictures are a mockery of all that is fair and equitable? Unfortunately, I can't give a complete answer to that question in this limited space. But I can tell you that his tracts are not our only concern. To state the matter in a few words, unlike everyone else in the world, he seriously believes that ethical responsibility is merely a trammel of earthbound mortals and should not be required of a demigod like him. Woo woooo! Here comes the clue train. Last stop: Wales. And that's it. Mr. Jimbo Wales is doing the very thing for which he criticizes others.   """,0

Talk:Female genital mutilation; please stop
Hi Elvey. I noticed you on Johnuniq's page, which I watch, and was moved to check out the discussion at Talk:Female genital mutilation. Your part of it worried me. While I have no opinion of my own on the statistics, as FGM is not a field I've studied, I see two principles in play on that talkpage, that are true for all articles, and that you seem to pay scant attention to: 

1) Use reliable secondary sources. It's important (for all articles, but more especially for a sensitive subject such as FGM) to be based on reliable secondary sources. Synthesising sources in order to argue, in Wikipedia's voice, with a UNICEF report from 2013 isn't on, unless you have a reliable source (as opposed to having your own synthesis and conclusions from sources) that offers the same argument. 
2) Consensus. Nobody (except partly Vetrisimino0) agrees with you about how the stats should be represented in the article. There is consensus against your section tags, described here as """"overly aggressive"""". I hope the issue of the tags has blown over, but a few days ago you kept restoring them, and defend them aggressively; the fact that the article is being prepped for WP:FAC seems to anger you further, and makes you accuse SlimVirgin of WP:OWN: a serious accusation, which shouldn't be made without good evidence, and which you have taken to SV's user talkpage as well.

Combative and unresponsive discussion sours the editing experience for other users. Everybody else is speaking respectfully to you, as far as I can see; you're the one that has been upping the temperature with posts like this, where you call Zad's comment """"blatantly untrue, not to mention insulting"""" — based, as far as I can see on a mistaken notion that he was impugning some arithmetic you had done (he wasn't). That kind of response reminds me of the old adage about the internet being populated by sensitive and angry people, """"eggshells armed with hammers"""" (Google tells me it was originally said of heavily armed but lightly protected battleships). Please don't jump so quickly to the conclusion that people are insulting you. Worse, your header here is a noxious bad-faith-assuming personal attack, something to be scrupulously avoided in section headers. And you put it as the header to a post by SlimVirgin, which you had moved there from your own talkpage. That is truly awful behaviour, seemingly designed to discourage others and chase them off. (Charming edit summary at your own page, btw.) If you can't stop yourself from getting angrier and angrier whenever you're contradicted (this post, aggressively attacking Johnuniq, is a charming recent example), I advise you to take a break from the article. That's advice. What I tell you, as an uninvolved admin, is that you must stop filling the talkpage with rehashing of arguments that have not carried conviction before, and you must stop attacking people. Your accusation against SlimVirgin that she is """"abusing her position as an administrator to gain advantage in a content dispute"""", currently at the bottom of the page, is made up out of whole cloth as far as I can see. Has she mentioned or hinted at being an admin, or warned you in any way? If I've missed where SV is playing the admin card, tell me where. The word """"disrupt"""", which she used and which looks to be the basis of your accusation, is by no means _ the prerogative of admins.  | talk .

I appreciate that you are trying to improve the encyclopedia by dealing with the conflict at FGM by taking the discussion here.  I wish you'd participate in the discussion of the facts instead.  I feel that in coming here, you raise/reiterate some good points, but I don't think you should be raising the first few, at least, here:
""""*1) Use reliable secondary sources."""" (emphasis is in the original)  I totally agree, and I said that in the discussion, """"The sources are given and reliable and secondary."""" and """"Also apropos """"Anything about prevalence needs a strong secondary source,"""" are you saying that the source we're using for reporting the UNICEF stats in the first place is better?

OK, I just tried to merge Cloud telephony into Web-based VoIP, and it did not work.  The reason is that the intros in both of those articles did not correctly define the concepts.  
 Cloud telephony is a subset of Cloud communications; it means third-party, off-site VoIP services in general.  This includes both web-based and non-web-based VoIP (it could just integrate with conventional telephones as a PBX replacement).
 Web-based VoIP simply uses a web page running a multimedia applet or whatever instead of dedicated non-web VoIP software

I propose merging Cloud telephony into Cloud communications instead; they are both very short and weak and there is substantial overlap.  I tagged both of those articles.

There is no section in Voice over IP into which to merge Web-based VoIP, since it defines a class of client software; though I did add an awkward link from the """"Protocols"""" section.  Clients are described at Comparison of VoIP software.  Web-based software is included there but not necessarily marked as such.  That's another potential merge target, but I don't have any problem leaving web-based VoIP as its own article for a while and letting it grow.  It may be handy to just be able to link there from several other articles. I removed the merge tag from Web-based VoIP for now, but feel free to rekindle the debate if you see fit.    """,0

When they fenced off the park, my truck was still parked in """"The Boneyard""""a place at 5th and Delaware in Berkeley where a number of people were building boats, vans and so on.  My neighbor, Alan Blanchard, had said goodbye to his wife, Sheila, and gone up to Telegraph Ave. to work at the Berkeley Reperatory Theater doing carpentry.  He heard some noise on the street, went up to the roof to see what was happening and was immediately hit by a volley of buckshot fired by an Alameda County Sheriff's deputy.  He never saw another thing, as he was permanently blinded.  James Rector, who was standing next to him, had seen the deputy point his shotgun at them; he turned and was running away when the blast hit him in the lower abdomen.  He died four days later.

I was in Sproul Plaza for Rector's memorial service just after he died.  The National Guard troops surrounded the plaza and pointed their bayonets inward, while helicoptors dropped CS gas directly on the thousands of people who had assembled.  Walking home after this gathering, we were assaulted by National Guard troops.  That night I defied the curfew and drove my truck all around Berkeleyno one was permitted on the streets after dark, and it was obviously a """"hippie truck""""yet they never stopped me, even at the roadblocks, which I ignored.

Yes, a whole other 60's saga.  Still makes me sad about Alanhis wife left him, and whenever I saw him after that he commented that he realized he would always remember me as he saw me on the last day he was sighted. """,0

Spamming: Posting an excessive number of messages to individual users, or to users with no significant connection to the topic at hand.
Campaigning: Posting a notification of discussion that presents the topic in a non-neutral manner.
Vote-stacking: Posting messages to users selected based on their known opinions (which may be made known by a userbox, user category, or prior statement). Vote-banking involves recruiting editors perceived as having a common viewpoint for a group, similar to a political party, in the expectation that notifying the group of any discussion related to that viewpoint will result in a numerical advantage, much as a form of prearranged vote stacking.
Stealth canvassing: Contacting users off-wiki (by e-mail, for example) to persuade them to join in discussions (unless there is a specific reason not to use talk pages)

 This is an interesting discussion with good points made by all. I can add a little bit that might be helpful. As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, """"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?"""" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).

 The beginning could say: """"Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required.

 The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context.

 In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.""""

Why do you? Are you a sock puppett? []",1
2862,"""Here is the summary:

 I agree that wikipedia articles may have pictures and it is preferable to show them for the convenience of the reader. The pictures of Jesus, Mary etc. are very commonly depicted in the churches and other places, so whenever there is article to explain about Jesus and christianity then it is much preferable to give the abstract idea to the user about how 'Christianity looks like and what is associated with it (including the pictures of Jesus and Mary)'. Now agreeing to the this, the problem is that there are no images associated to Muhammad or other Prophets in Muslims as well as Mosques and any other places. So, when a reader will come to know about Isamic articles then he will be given the idea of 'how Islam looks like and what is associated to Isalm and Muhammad (including Islamic calligraphy)'. Now if there does not exist and prominent association about Muhammad's picture then it is NOT necessary to somehow bring 'Any insignificant' picture no matter it is drawn by some 12 year old kid or some very unpopular artist who is not only unknown in the nonIslamic world but Muslims too.
 So, when a Muslim comes to the article about Muhammad, he will just feel strange on the rediculous depiction and might even laugh that """"I did'nt know there is such picture used about Islam"""". 
 Imagine the misery of a wikipedia article in where the follower of the religion himself has to laugh at what is being shown as a fact about his religion.  
 I hope my comments look valid at the same time when I agree about the value of an image where it is actually represending the article and not contradicting it.

Speedy deletion of WiSens(R), a portfolio of IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee products such as protocol analyzer, commissioner, network manager etc.,
 A tag has been placed on WiSens(R), a portfolio of IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee products such as protocol analyzer, commissioner, network manager etc., requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a company or corporation, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for companies and corporations. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

So we have the referenced materials for the Marquis de Lafayette, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, etc. and then your retraction.  I think this talk page is out of date or something.  In any event please update the talk page with the next actions.  

Change the aforementioned pages to reflect only the given name and change the subject of this talk session to be the same.  Would you say that is correct?

You know, it does, as I ponder it, make a great deal more sense to use the name and the various titles held in peerage, or otherwise under the person's given name.  There are tons of examples in every direction.  

So I see a basic three tiered approach.  The Person Document > The Honorary Title Document such as Baron, Duke, Knight, etc.? with iiluminating text in a section such as ===Early Life=== or perhaps ===Nobility Titles=== or something along those lines.  I enjoy refining documents to be more clear and include the """"much"""" additional insights found on Wikipedia and link to them.  

I await your direction on how to proceed.

I put a reference from the ABOUT US of Ojigbani in the space where the article says that he considers his ministry is not a church. So I put that reference because in the ABOUT US, it stated his ministry is not a church. But when I saw the tag, I removed the reference and was able to see an article from a newspaper that states Ojigbani's ministry is not a church.

 List of USN ships 

Hello, I've been doing some updating and correcting on the article List of current ships of the United States Navy. I see that you contributed a great deal to article previously. At one point, with about a half dozen edits, you added 24 ships to the section """"Ready Reserve Force ships"""". You listed them all as belonging to the Cape Ducato class, however that is a class of only 5 ships.

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your band, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

 Gyroscopic Inertial Thrusters 

Interesting discussion. The greatest hindrance to discovery and invention is MENTAL INERTIA, and the treatment of science as though it is a dogmatic religion.
 
Can anyone cite an authority that made the ridiculous statement that angular accelerations and momentum can NOT be exchanged for linear accelerations and momentum?
 
Such claims were made by Edison, attempting to discredit Tesla's alternating current. Mass and momentum equations are remarkably similar to the math involving electronics.
 
Over 20 others repeated my experiments, converting angular accelerations into linear acceleration, passing pendulum, water, ice skid, and air table tests.
 
Conservation of energy is NOT violated, since energy is required to change the velocity or direction of the device.  While only small """"anomalous"""" amounts of thrust have been generated, the venemous nature of religion in the name of science has been VERY difficult to overcome.
 
""""Do NOT confuse me with facts and experiments that appear to violate a BASIC TENNANT of physics, it is IMPOSSIBLE, therefore I will disbelieve my lying eyes!"""" - is the too common reaction when any attempt is made to further this field of research.  This is inconvenient, and NOT helpful, especially when fanatics insist on erasing any facts that do not conform to their religious views of science.

These completely negative actions need to be reversed.

I also have the Courage League Division Two tables for these dates, and would like to add these to Wikipedia.  Unfortunately I don't want to do so because such tables take time to write and such writing is clearly not appreciated by some people who ought to know better.

If I am caught talking to you, some people may well block me on sight, so I may be unable to reply.

 _/|\_I don't know why the Removed Features section claims that the classic start menu and taskbar will be
 removed. Nor do I know why the Inkball game is supposedly removed. This section cites no references and these
 claims are the most questionable.  

I'm not sure as the the reasons as to why they we're removed but I can tell you that Ink Ball is not found anywhere in the beta release, I'm not sure about the classic start menu and taskbar, i don't see an option for them but I didn't look all that hard   

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea. We need a reliable source saying Microsoft has decided to remove it. There could be plenty of reasons why it's not in beta, only one of them is Microsoft has decided to remove it completely

Konnichiwa, senpai
Please notice me
I watch Asian cartoons
I'm a weeaboo

I live in my mom's house
I'm like 32
I collect swords and throwing stars
'Cause I'm a weeaboo

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I will always be one step ahead of you
Because I read the manga
(You're such a fucking pleb, are you even even Japanese bro?)

I haven't showered in like 16 weeks
All my friends and peers are ashamed of me
'Cause all of a sudden
I think I'm Japanese

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm a weeaboo (x4)
A filthy weeaboo
(Naruto's so overrated)
A dirty weeaboo
(You wanna see my katana collection?)
A fucking weeaboo
(I'm learning Japanese on Rosetta Stone)
A disgusting weeaboo
(So I'm like basically Japanese now)

[Verse 2]
I sit at my computer desk
And argue with teenagers on the internet
About atheism
And how Japan is superior to other countries
I learned a bit of Japanese
So now i'm qualified to be a part of their community
So i made my avatar a kawaii waifu

Yes, I'm a weeaboo

I would appreciate if you could show me what can be done in each of paragraphs:

1st paragraph:
Having been the early Brazilian republican period, nothing more than a Army dictatorship, already in 1891 from the unfoldings of the bubble of encilhamento and the 1st naval revolt, the country entered in a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by several rebellions, both civilian as military, which little by little undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most military, lead a revolt.

2nd:
Vargas and the military, who were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891's Constitution, closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers, replacing the states' governors with their supporters. Under the Claiming of the broken promises of changing, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power and in 1935 the Communists rebelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

3rd:
In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of this period, was followed by a failed attempt to permanently exert a prominent role in the League of Nations, after its involvement in World War I. In World War II Brazil remained neutral until August of 1942, when the country entered in that war on the allied side after suffer retaliations undertaken by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, due the country have severed diplomatic relations with them in the wake of Pan-American Conference. With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, being the Democracy """"reinstated"""" by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before. Having returned to power democratically elected at the end of 1950, Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis.

Wikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",1

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own. 

Hey - I can play Hungarian Rhapsody... can I have a page???",1

Nevertheless, this bio, which I wrote, does appear in various public forums so I hope that it doesnt present any problems.  Here is what I would like to say:

Andy Brick is a prolific composer, conductor and symphonist.  In 2003 Brick set a historic milestone conducting the Czech National Symphony Orchestra in the world’s first symphonic game music concert at the Gewandaus, Leipzig Germany to a sold out audience of 2200.  Andy wrote the fanfare to this historic concert event which featured his music for Merregnon II. He has served as the exclusive principle conductor and music director of the concert series leading repeatedly sold out performances from 2003-2008. In 2005 Andy was appointed music director of  the European concert series, “Heros of Imagination”.  This concert series featured new symphonic music written by Andy and performed by the Neue Elbland Philharmonie.  Brick also served as music director for the first Chamber Music Concert of the Kammerphilharmonie.  Brick has conducted over 70 game titles including Final Fantasy, Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, Halo, and World of Warcraft with orchestras throughout the world including The Prague Symphony, The Czech National Symphony, The North Carolina Symphony, The Bratislava Symphony, The Moravian Philharmonic, The Filmharmonic of Prague and members of the New York Philharmonic and Detroit Symphony.

 ex-Yugoslav yellow house connection 

You may remember the resignation of Ms. Carla del Ponte, the UN's chief investigator for former Yugoslavia war crimes. She resigned after she learned the kosovan alban militants culled 300 cage-held serbian civilians and POWs and sold their organs to Turkey.

She was prevented from pursuing this """"Yellow House atrocity"""" case any further, because serbs were the NATO pre-assigned evil and kosovans were the designated """"friends of the democracy"""" at the time. Yet, the serb gov't promised to investigate it further and avenge on the perpetrators, including the ethnic alban master terrorirst Hasim Tachi.

It turns out the culled serb's organs were sent to Turkey to be transplanted into wealthy jewish patients!""",0

Where is the """" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??

   DNA studies in Spaniards show that less than 2% have Moor blood. It has been weed out,since the fall of Cordova in 1236, by the """" limpieza de sangre"""" campaign of the christians. Spaniards are White as are the anglo-saxons,and the Irish.

Fair use rationale for Image:AdamSawLawrence.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:AdamSawLawrence.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is not a suitable explanation or rationale as to why each specific use in Wikipedia constitutes fair use.  Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

 Hypocrisy 

I'm sick of this clique mentality. Rodhullandemu told me my proposed contribution to an article was worth """"fuck all"""". He also aggressively removed a legitimate talking point from the article's talk page as """"unsourced bollocks"""". My contribution which, apparently, was worth """"fuck all"""" and was """"piss poor"""" is currently featured in the article. It was cited (by me) and must have passed some scrutiny to remain in the article. Right?

Doubtless these inconvenient facts will do little to change your mind regarding my block. But at least show a little consistency with regards to personal attacks and use of profanities. The truth is, Rodhullandemu began all this anomosity between him and I and it all goes back to this. I'm sure this constitutes a personal attack, especially as I've since been vindicated regarding our feud (ie; I was 100% correct; he was not).

How come these idiots, who can not even correctly interpret or understand the historical references/citations, be entrusted with the task to edit serious articles on ancient people like the Kambojas? It is  also amusing to learn that such-like dorks are trying to define the historical out-lines of the Kamboj history on Wikipedia! It is highly desirable that these fuck'in self-styled Wikipedia administrators/commentators first need to learn  to correctly interpret and interpret the historical references. Only then may they be qualified to comment on the serious topic like Kamboj history or else earn the rights to edit informative articles on this wlllknown ancient historical People. Also these jerks first need to understand that the citations and quotations used in the Kamboj related articles are from the most scholarly writers on this subject. It is shameful that these FEW F*- SELF-STYLED IDIOT ADMINSTIRATORS (LIKE DABU(DAB),ITSMJUDITH and the like) are trying to sit on judgement on the Kamboj history on Wikipedia and are bent on distorting or deleting the genuine information about them which is not found in the books writtemn in English, Fench or German by their European writers! Well, if you can interpret even the references quoted in an article, howcome can you sit in judgement and offer your scholarly comments on the Kamboj history? It is first necessary that these adminitrators/editors like Fuck'n Dabbu and his ilk, first need to familiarise  themselves about the current available historical information on Kamboj history-only then can they qualify themselves to edit the serious articles on the Kambojkas?'.And, I'll see how long these ignorant, prejudiced-minded idiots can continue to block me from editing articles on  Wikipedia?????''.

903,"Where is the data for your claims on accidents?  It's hard to imagine that head-on crashes of stage coaches were common occurrences. Accidents in competitions involving horses are fairly common, but bad outcomes on simple trips to town from the herders' camp to town for grub would most likely have involved bandits and other such hazards. And another thing, at the time when horses were in common use for transportation, traffic density was much lower than at the present time.  Riding through a deserted Fairmont Park in Philadelphia, a rider on a horse going at a walking pace and a rider in a car doing the speed limit would both be quite safe. Riders galloping would at most risk falling off going at about 25 mph. Drivers speeding with an equal degree of recklessness might spin out on a curve at 75 mpg. Riders can wear helmets that protect against brain damage but not broken necks. Drivers can use seat belts, and racing drivers can use other protections, so it is a little difficult to know what is being compared to what.  Even so, the deadly injuries among non-competition horse accidents are almost all head injuries suffered by riders whose horses spook for some reason. (See Jessica Jahiel's website.) The commonest injuries would most likely be broken arms from riders who fall.  A car crash at even relatively low speeds can produce the same head injuries (which is why cars now have padded dash boards), and as speeds increase the probability of serious injuries to the head and trunk becomes much higher.

As for feces, true, horse manure is not too appealing to walk through with bare feet, and somebody needs to remove it from the road. On the other hand, it is not toxic the way lead is. Once removed from the road, it can be used to produce good compost.  Even if people just leave it on a country road, it soon packs down into a uniform brown soft and well-compacted mass. Leave a clump of horse manure on your front yard and it become fertilizer. Dump a cup of used engine oil on your yard and you have long-term contamination.",0

Tango: There are infinitely many numbers between 0.999... and 1 - check the archives and you will find a clear example. You are incorrectly assuming that the limit of a series determines a number. If you insist on defining a number by a series (in fact this is circular), you must be consistent: what is the limit of any irrational number defined as a Cauchy sequence? You do not know, therefore you cannot use this definition. Furthermore, the apparatus for comparing numbers in decimal form must be consistent. You start wih the most significant digit in the representation and continue the comparison until you find two digits that are not equal. Having 0.999... = 1, contradicts this method. You must also remember that it is impossible to represent all numbers in any radix system. Most numbers can only be approximated.

4. The project talk page is intended to be the hub of the project, where members discuss articles and help each other improving them. Until very recently it has been almost inactive, but do you check the project talk page?
Answer:

4a. If the talk page was more active, would you get involved in discussions there?
Answer:

5. When viewing Cheshire-related articles, are there any issues that have stood out as needing attention or frustrated you? (Traditional counties POV, poor coverage about a particular subject, vandalism going unnoticed etc)
Answer:

6. Maintaining the Cheshire portal is one of the Cheshire WikiProject's main aims, providing a display of the best and most up to date articles that are part of the project. There is currently a drive to promote it to featured status, but input from a wide range of members is needed. Do you have the portal on your watchlist?
Answer:

7. Would you be interesting in subscribing to a newsletter covering North West England, with details of work done by WikiProjects representing Cheshire, Greater Manchester, and Merseyside?
Answer:

8. Finally, are there any improvements or initiatives you'd like to see WP:CHES undertake, or general comments you'd like to make?

 Thank you for putting inline citation into the lead. 
 Primary sources are discouraged by the guideline delineated on WP:MEDRS. The rational behind this is discussed in detail on that page. This policy is the result of a period of evolution after several years of community discussion. If you disagree with that policy, the correct place to raise your concerns would be on the talk page for the guideline. While that guideline stands however, please let me assure you that the primary sources need to be removed, and if possible replaced with reliable secondary and tertiary sources. If no replacement sources are available, then the content is not notable [yet] for wikipedia. This does not mean that the content is irrelevant on a wider stage (e.g. in scientific circles), but Wikipedia has guidelines for what is notable enough for inclusion in the encyclopedia entries. I include a brief sweep to move the discussion forwards below. Main issues appear to be 1. primary sources, 2. WP:MEDDATE, 3. otherwise unreliable sources 4. possible conflict of interest (?).

Paul O'Connor, a laboratory technologist who assisted in the autopsy of President Kennedy, claimed that the autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital was conducted in obedience to a high command of admirals and generals. O'Connor stated: 

There were kind of mysterious civilian people, in civilian clothes — were there [at Bethesda]. It seemed like they commanded a lot of respect and attention — sinister looking people. They would come up and look over my shoulder, or look over Dr. Boswell's shoulder, and run back, and they'd have a little conference in the corner.

It is not that I am seeking a re-review as such, but rather seeking more specific instructions on how I could change the article to have it submitted successfully. In terms of the notability of the subject, the newspaper articles I have referenced talk about his popularity in Australia where he was a regular on television and popular. I'm happy for the page to be edited if anyone has better sources than me. I think that part of the issue is that his peak in popularity was during a period where the internet barely existed. It probably also doesn't help that he's Australian and therefore not as well known as he may be if he was on American television. He would regularly sell out 2,000-3,000 seat venues during his peak. I understand that these things need to be verifiable and that my article may not be up to scratch, but for a first time attempt at editing a Wikipedia article, it's difficult to navigate the seemingly convoluted process (to the uninitiated like myself).",0

I don't buy those arguments.

First, there has also been a recent trend of creating a season article for every Division I program for each of the last 3 or so seasons. I see no reason that that trend won't start to backtrack into earlier teams. Pages getting deleted have less to do with the notion of a single-season article being inherently non-notable, than it has to do with those specific articles not being up to standards. Just look at all the single-season Nebraska football articles that are being created and kept. You say, """"There will never be a separate article for any of these pre-2000 Gators football teams."""" That's a rather bold proclamation to issue on behalf of all editors, present and future. Never say never.

I don't buy that you need to bypass the redirect to take the reader to the applicable section. That's why the season redirects typically redirect to the correct section in the target article. Even better, in case the sections get renamed, only the redirect will need to have its link tweaked, rather than the set of all articles that bypassed the redirect.

Just because there is only one single season article between 1906 and 1999 right now, it does not preclude the distinct possibility of there being more. Especially when many of those 1990's squads finished in the top 10, and the 1995 team actually played in the national championship game - how is that not notable?

Merging the decade articles is a fine consensus. I'm in no way countering that. However, consensus can change over time, and there is no need to prevent other articles from linking to new Florida season articles should that situation ever arise.

I don't know why you bring in broken links, unless you're suggesting that the decade articles would be deleted, and that somehow the bot could figure out to point the link at the season article at that point. Why not keep it simple, and leave the link to the redirect. That way, there is no need for this magic bot. That's one of the main features of redirects: to serve as a placeholder for a possible future article distinct from the redirect target. You call my arguments specious, yet I'm not the one trying to justify departure from accepted Wikipedia guidelines.

True, the answer is obvious. Have the redirect point at the correct section of the decade article. Simple as that. I'll even help update the redirect targets. FaultRyan """,0

My name is Dean Estes. I met Snakefinger (Mr. Lithman) in 1981 when he and his band played on the front lawn of our high school. One of his band members, a former Dead Kennedy, had attended the school and made this cool event possible. I don't know why Steve Crabtree claims that Lithman was American and was not of European descent. Technically it may be true that the UK is not part of """"Europe"""" despite being a charter member of the EU, but Mr. Crabtree's claims risk giving an false impression. Phil """"Snakefinger"""" Lithman was English, as is easily verified and as was clearly obvious when the man spoke. Perhaps Steve meant that Snakefinger was living in America? (Specifically San Francisco.) Two years later I was fortunate enough to befriend one of The Residents. While I was savvy enough not to ask certain questions until enough trust had been earned, I do recall, during a discussion of the The Residents' remarkably unique sense of harmonization, asking if N. Senada had actually existed. My Resident acquaintance simply smiled and shrugged his shoulders, which I knew was a nice way of saying """"we aren't going there,"""" so I didn't pursue it. I believe it's pretty obvious that """"the mysterious N. Senada"""" never actually existed when you review the various things that have been said about him. Isn't the amusing play on the name of the Baja Mexican town """"Ensenada"""" clue enough? However, this is another case where the question of whether or not such aspects of the Residents mythos """"matter"""" is perfectly valid. Of course it doesn't really matter. As one of the people who actually does know the answers to some of the speculation here, it's so strange, seeing how some people post misinformation with conviction (intentionally?) while others deny facts. For the most part, to quote an old Eno lyric, """"those who know, they don't let it show.""""  -) Mystery and myth are more fun, and I think it's safe to say that's part of the point of the Residents' myriad mysteries. Nevertheless, while Snakefinger protected The Residents' secrets, he wasn't secretive about his own """"real"""" identity or history at all. My apologies to Steve if I've misunderstood him.""",0

Apology accepted, however even if the characterization is accurate for other editors, it serves no purpose in bringing it up.  Making disputes personal rarely enhances dialogue.  Anyway, I think you've concluded basically the same thing I have: such a broadening of definition would include many people who really should not be considered philosophers.  Consider, for instance, Ayn Rand.  She wrote on the topics of metaphysics, ethics, etc, but she did so rhetorically and without actually attempting to prove her points using syllogistic logic.  She contributed nothing to human knowledge, both because her reasoning was fallacious and because any of her actually valid conclusions had already been documented by previous philosophers (for instance, """"objectivist"""" metaphysics are simply a renamed naturalistic metaphysics).  I don't mean to group Dawkins with Rand of course as Dawkins is, in my opinion, a brilliant man who has contributed much to human knowledge.  But this is my point: using such a broadened definition puts Dawkins, Rand, Kant, Mill, and Russel in the same category, which I think is prima facie an incorrect grouping.  

Now, as to your point that philosophers will favor their own: well yes, but the same should be said for biologists and physicists.  When we write an article on evolution we value the discoveries of biology and not of religion.  Philosophy is and basically always has been an academic enterprise, starting with the post-religious works of the Sophists/Plato/Aristotle/etc as they founded the world's first philosophical academies.  Since then the practice of philosophy has undergone many manifestations but even among those differences it is generally somewhat easy to tell what is philosophy and what is simply on the subject of philosophy but not actually philosophy.  For instance, the analytical school of philosophy, I think, should not hesitate to consider continental philosophy something other than philosophy, it is just considered to be incorrect (being very general here).  From a Wikipedia standpoint, encyclopedias themselves are an academic enterprise and as such when we're considering how to assign WP:WEIGHT to a subject we do so by reference to experts in that subject.  Whether rightly or wrongly, the experts on philosophy have yet to recognize Dawkins as a philosopher, but as WP editors our job is not to determine whether or not Dawkins is really a philosopher, but rather to consider the expert opinion on the matter and give due weight to minority views when appropriate. talk """,0

Below I am pasting an email from a historian, whom I asked about the correct title.| talk  

The truth is that the English language really has no equivalent to Freiherr (the title of the ruler) or Freiherrschaft (the title of the political entity), because neither or them existed in the English-speaking world.  The loose translations sometimes given (baron, barony) are inaccurate, in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction.  Medieval English barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these (except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of Durham and a few other historical exotica).
The concept wasn't limited to Silesia.  It existed throughout the Holy Roman Empire and within the hereditary domains of the Habsburgs, such as Bohemia after 1621.

""""The therapy is both ineffective and dangerous""""

First of all, I believe the writer of this page needs to look into people such as John Christopher, Richard Schulze and Bernard Jensen. Following your research, you need to look into Hippocrates Health Institute. These men and that institution implements many dynamics of Gerson Therapy, and all have had wildly impressive results with numerous testimonies.

The supporting sources make vague allusions to """"inconclusive"""" results simply because no large-scale studies have been conducted. 

""""There is very little scientific evidence to support the use of other components of the Gerson regimen""""
""""There have been no well-controlled studies published in the available medical literature that show the Gerson therapy is effective in treating cancer.""""

As per the very site you source. The fact of the matter is Gerson Therapy and its many dynamics have been in use by a multitude of other alternative health practitioners and institutions, all the while having more success than our modern cancer treatment.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2602:306:CC6D:B140:2DF8:E1A5:6C82:1D53   

""""As per the very site you source. The fact of the matter is Gerson Therapy and its many dynamics have been in use by a multitude of other alternative health practitioners and institutions, all the while having more success than our modern cancer treatment""""

Ten Point Plan (AKA the Pee-wee Manifesto)NOTE: THIS IS NOT VANDALISM

I demand that the following conditions be met and complied with or else face the wrath of my never ending and growing database of vandal attacks. if you wish for my vandalism to cease, simply, you must comply with my standards in the following Ten Point Plan:

1. user:Gscshoyru and User:Dreadstar must both cease ALL wikipedia activity and disband their accounts, or at the very least negotiable, cease your administrator status. this condition MUST be met to stop the vandalism. if this conditon is not met, the vandalism will not cease (users, if you really cared for wikipedia as you both claim, surely it would be in wikipedia's interest to stop me from vandalising, so in order to stop me, you must stop your wikipedia activity and/or drop your admin status) any time in the perceivable future.

2. That in the article """"Ronald Mcdonald"""", Ronald is listed as a """"happy"""" clown

3. That any defaming or negative remarks regarding Pee Wee Herman or Paul Reubens are removed

4. That any new edits to either Ronald Mcdonald or Paul Reubens are approached with respect (i.e, no bad/negative comments, no defamation, nothing that can be perceived as hurting the reputation of Ronald Mcdonald or Pee Wee Herman

5. That ALL articles regarding Mcdonalds, fast-food, hamburgers, french fries, and good corporate practice carry the """"Mcdonald's arch""""

6. that further more, the """"Paul Reubens"""", """"Pee-Wee Herman"""", """"Tony Curtis"""", """"Maury Povich"""", and """"Construction"""" articles are protected and NEVER updated ever again

7. that the """"controversy"""" section from the article on Mcdonald's is removed

8. that any reference to Paul Reubens carry the word """"funny"""" preceding it

9. that any reference to a Mcdonalds product carry the word """"tasty"""" preceding it

10. And finally, that an account that I create (soon to be announcedyou will know what it is called) be granted administrator status.

This is my ten-point plan. I, Pee-Wee Herman, AKA Clown hater, AKA Pee Wee Vandal, have spoken.   """,0

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson.

Maybe on the disambig page - """"3 can mean.... literature: The Three Little Pigs, The Three Bears, Three Blind Mice, etc.""""  Three Bears is a popular Russian chocolate candy, do we include that here as well?  I can see how cases where the numeral 3 is used in common classification systems - such as the periodic table, or even positions in sports (the first baseman is literally referred to as """"3"""" in phrases such as """"4-6-3 double play""""), but things like """"three witches in macbeth"""" seem much more eehhhhhhhh.  maybe this is an issue to be argued with the whole wikinumbers project.  i only have issue with this page because when i stumbled on it some 10 months ago it actually had A COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS AMOUNT of unnecessary, marginally significant, and horribly formatted content, and I actually want this website to be good and useful instead of a godawful pile of crap.

ok,  this misses some of the key points and misstates it a bit. I appreciate your effort though.  Precise definition is difficult to paraphrase, isn't it?

""""other authorities agree that they will not overrule""""
their agreement is not necessary, only the legal right to not be overruled 

De facto sovereignty, the second, is actual power,  
'the actual exercise'  'actually using'...etc.    of that power.  But 'power' that's a word that can't be used in this sense without FURTHER definition,because it's too ambiguous outside of a context that specifically implies what meaning is meant.                                  

I think if we have the word 'exclusive' (the key point) in the opening paragraph, the rest can be saved for the later paragraph, where it is now... sparing people who just want the overview from reading mumbojumbo, but retaining the info for those who want a more thorough exposition.

If a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.

I think this is a splendid summation of the concept of defacto sovereignty  I think if we 
keep the defacto vs dejure info in the 'differing views' section, it ties together the 3 seemingly different views by the common thread of, """"no matter what your view is on sovereignty , you have to have it to use it and use it to have it""""

and if we add your summary it makes the 'differing views' section just about right. 

A key element of sovereignty in the legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction. 

Specifically, when a decision is made by a sovereign entity, it cannot generally be ovverruled by a higher authority.  Further, it is generally held that another legal element of sovereignty requires not only the legal right to exercise power, but the actual exercise of such power.  (""""no de jure sovereignty without de facto sovereignty"""") In other words, neither claiming/being proclaimed Sovereign, nor merely exercising the power of a Sovereign is sufficient, sovereignty requires both elements. 

If a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.

But if I may? I think this is one tiny bit better, as it applies to the anarchists, monarchs,etc:
If a sovereign - person or state - can make a decision but cannot carry it out, their recognized sovereignty is essentially meaningless.

In that form, I really like it.  How does that read to you? I think at this point the article is accurate, and pretty safe to expand on.  If the readability issue is good, (I'm blind to that, Ive read too much legalese to notice much if it sounds stilted or awkward), I'd say we are pretty set. Want to pick at it a bit and post your change?  I think it's a consensus at this point, pretty much.""",0

Also in Good faith, my preferred compromise is to use both the principal terms in question: Country and constituent country for Scotland  & England, together with principality and province used for Wales and Northern Ireland respectively, as per the terminology used in BS ISO 3166-2:2007 (second edition). (The term constituent country being cited from the UK Government). These being as follows:
Scotland (Gaelic: Alba) is a country that occupies the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the south with England. England (Cornish: Pow Sows) is a country that occupies most of the southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares land borders to the north with Scotland and to the west with Wales. 
Wales (;Also spelled """"Gymru"""", """"Nghymru"""" or """"Chymru"""" in certain contexts, as Welsh is a language with initial mutations – see Welsh morphology. pronounced }) is a principality that occupies the largest western peninsula of the island of Great Britain. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the east with England. Northern Ireland' (Irish: Tuaisceart Éireann, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann'') is a province that occupies the northeast of the island of Ireland. It is a constituent country of the United Kingdom, and shares a land border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland.
All of the above terms are verifiable and can be cited from reliable sources, which in addition to the ISO include:

 Gabrielle LeDoux 

I really did have more to say about Sharon Cissna.  It's probably nothing more than a series of moot points, seeing as how her campaign has gained approximately zero traction.  If she's even shown her face here in Fairbanks, I'm sure I would have heard about it, and yet I haven't.

 Just saw your post a minute ago. I haven't had any time to look at Wikipedia in a while. You're quite correct. I defer to your more extensive fund of information on AK politics. I'm not sure why Sharon wasted her filing fee. There has been zero campaign, reflected in the lack of traction. Phone messages left for her after her announcement and e-mail both went unanswered. I saw the contributions filing last week and see Vondesaar, Homer's version of Theresa Obermeyer, is in second place with less than $200 for the quarter. Actually, I'm thinking he's actually more like that bag lady from FBX who ran Senate, was it, about 20 years ago.  Sylvia something? If Alaska were Nevada, """"None of the above"""" could sweep the primaries and general elections. You live in Fairbanks? I had no idea. I thought you were a Washington State radio person or a punk rock band -). Given her name recognition, I expect she might win the primary if the party doesn't put out a mailer for Matt.   

Now, on to Gabrielle LeDoux.  Once again, big gaping holes which require addressing.  First, Kurt LeDoux ran for Kodiak's Senate seat in 1982 as a Democrat, unsuccessfully challenging the Republican incumbent, Bob Mulcahy.  Gabrielle LeDoux was herself a Democrat for many years, including originally filing as such in 2004 before switching to the Republicans at the last minute.  

 I didn't realize she had switched. I haven't paid much attention to Kodiak since Zharoff left office. I do remember that LeDoux hugely outraised Ogg, with most of her money coming from lawyers and labor from Anchorage. Can't remember if she had a general election opponent. She ran, unsuccessfully, for the house in 2000. Her mayor's win was nonpartisan, right?  

Second, she moved to Anchorage not long after leaving her House seat.  She ran against Pete Petersen in 2010.  Petersen himself could also be classified as a carpetbagger, considering that he ran in 2004 against Bob Lynn, who represents a district clear on the opposite side of Anchorage.  Contrast the Petersen-LeDoux race with the first race in the new district in 2002, when media accounts specifically pointed out the deep roots that both Tom Anderson and Owen Carey had in East Anchorage.  

 Thanks for all your input. Please feel free to change or add.  I doh't have any ownership in Sharon's page.   

 """"Carpetbagger"""" is a term that originally meant moving from a Northern state to run in the Deep South, after the Civil War, didn't it?  Moving a few miles in Anchorage would seem to be a bit of a stretch, to warrant that label.  Anderson's race of course was the one before McGuire made Tom stop wearing the wire and he was indicted at the end of his final year in the House. The only district which jogs my memory, unfortunately, was the kerfuffle over which district Valdez and maybe Whittier would be redistricted into in 2002. (Harris  scored?) Not nearly as big a to-do as Tuckerman's first massive gerrymandering attempt in 1992.   """,0

 Also concerning TheCommish21 

First of all, your statement about the Underground Football League was incorrect.  It is not a fantasy football league.  The UFL is a full-contact, tackle football league based in Macungie, PA, that attracts teenagers (ranging from 9th to 12th graders) from all over the Lehigh Valley.  There are referees, statisticians, an official rulebook, and permenant teams.  It is not just a hobby that was created without any sort of solid foundation.  It's website is growing rapidly, with nearly 6000 hits since the beginning of October.  Merely because it is local and young, does not mean that it doesn't hold a solid enough position in the world to have a Wikipedia page.  Your response to the Perl citation was a weak showing of how the UFL did not deserve a page.  Perhaps there are people who are very interested in football.  They might be interested in seeing how leagues in other areas.  If someone has a vested interest in something, they should be allowed to access information about it.  Isn't that what Wikipedia is all about?

Oh well done. I'm such a bad boy for """"attacking"""" the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""". Jesus Christ. All I wanted to know was why the Trayvon Martin case is not on the front page, and now I know - the people making the decisions about such things are just talking utter crap, and people like you who are apparently so threatened by the prospect of the outside world finding this out, you're prepared to shut me up, forcibly (and more despicably, others then remove my comments as if they had never been made at all). Well done. Now the """"1st Lord Baron Wikipedia"""" can feel safe in the knowledge that he doesn't have to exlain why he thinks a 20,000 word article and a 15,000 word article on something that's being reported around the world, has """"negligible encyclopedic value"""". And now someone who calls himself a bucket thinks the Lord was simply exercising """"most right and proper good humor"""" in acting that way. And the person going around erasing all my comments to hide them from outsiders calls himself a """"Rambling Man"""". Very apt. This isn't an encyclopedia, it's a playground. It only remains to be seen what the name """"Bishonen"""" means, but I doubt it's anything remotely intellectual, probaby just a cartoon reference or something. You can block me for 48 hours, but on this evidence, Wikipedia is going to be a poor excuse of a website encyclopedia for life. On further investigation, the 1st Lord seems to have got me blocked by crying to admins, which seems apt, seeing as he's probably just a child himself. Presumably the use of the phrase """"Bishonen with her finger on the trigger"""" over there waa meant to be funny, but given the context of my complaint, it's just rather tragic. Still, back to the real world, where the Trayvon Martin case is actually real news, and the issues it involves are of encyclopedic value. I've found the articles myself without the help of the front page, but apparently anyone else looking for them can just go to hell (in a bucket?). All, you Lords, Hell Buckets and Rambling men get back to whatever the fuck it is you do around here, which is cleearly not creating a useful encyclopedia (at least you don't seem to be getting in the way of the people who actually managed to write the articles on the shooting and trial, so thank fuck for that).""",1

God damn, it doesn't matter IF I DO provide proof. As you will put a pro-russian spin on it anyway.
As you and your russian buddies did already numerous times. 

The reason this pro-russian bias on this article keeps reoccuring is because Ymblanter is an admin and possibly other pro-russian admins are allowing this. Also, your lack of understanding of a Neutral Point of View doesn't help either.

Tricky situatian you got yourself into here, shame that I don't have the time or the motivation to meddle is pointless discussions with people who are brainwashed into thinking that they have nothing to do with Crimea by their own government. 

Just open any site that isin't Russia Today, and you'll see the real situation in Crimea and not what Ymblanter or any of your russian buddies are trying to portray here. I've had numerous discussions with pro-russians and I know that you don't have the capabilities to think by yourself, even If you had - Ymblanter would come in and adjust it to give a false impression of russian """"uninvolvement"""" in the matter.

A and C. The layout and image choice in A appears to be better balanced than B, however as someone pointed out above, the image has not scaled well to the size displayed in the collapse boxes above so that needs to be improved. Correct balancing is important, and the oversized top aerial shot at the top of B unbalances the rest of that image. On the second choice, C is broadly a better picture. While it shows more of the structure itself, the image composition on D is way off - the skyline is inappropriately placed in the bottom third and because of its angle it gives the spires undue attention and creates a vast area of empty sky.

, I really don’t care whether this article states that the suspect origins are Sino-Korean or not (largely because I think the theory is a whole bunch of Korean nationalist propaganda). However, if you’re going to edit the article, at least use grammatical English. Instead of writing:

Write:
On the other hand, some scholars have suspected that the real reason for the refusal may be Japan’s worry about the possibility of finding evidence of the Japanese imperial line’s suspected xenogenesis therein.
“Xenogenesis” comes from “xeno-”, a prefix meaning “foreign” or “alien” (like the “gai” in “gaikokujin”), + “genesis”, meaning “origin” or “creation” = “foreign origin”; it is mainly used in biology to mean something different, but I think the rarer usage will be understood here.  12:15, 1 February",0

In addition to lacking a biography for Emperor Ling of Han, the Records of the Three Kingdoms carry no biography for Emperor Shao or Emperor Xian of Han.

 If most Protestants were not 'informers' that would probably be because they had no information to pass on. However I think Sarah unwittingly and superbly illustrates the reason why using the word 'informer' in this article is utterly inappropriate and far from neutral. 
She says """"common usage in Ireland [so] describes (then and now), local inhabitants who give information to the British."""" 
But Ireland then and now also includes the Protestant north whose Protestant inhabitants see themselves as British and would no more think of not 'informing' than would an American who spotted an Al Quaeda operative setting up an ambush in Chicago. And they would not be pleased to have the epithet 'informer' thrown at them. 
Irish Protestants in the south then, or the north now would never use the word 'informer' in this context and their view should not be disregarded in Wikipedia. Sarah may assume they do not exist or are irrelevant but their continued existence is the reason she is editing this article in the first place. Neutrality requires another phrasing.   """,0

The lede is supposed to encapsulate the rest of the article which is quiet clear that this was a murder - not an accidental, natural or judicially sanctioned death.

I do sympathise and understand that for Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA, the current phase of the conflict is about the definition of the conflict itself. For the self-esteem of the so-called republican movement, and for the political future of Sinn Féin, it is vital that its 30-year campaign of violence be remembered as a just war, a regrettable but necessary method of achieving a legitimate aim. The vile and sordid deeds that run through that campaign may, under pressure, be described as wrong. They may be accepted as """"mistakes"""". PIRA may acknowledge, in the curiously passive language it favours, that these things """"should not have happened"""". But they must never, ever, be called crimes. God forbid!

830,"No singers here, I guess. She may well have a 5-octave range, but singers are defined by their *effective* range, not merely the pitch boundaries of their natural range (including the falsetto). However, Carey is a phenomenal singer regardless of her full range. Hell, I have a range of over three octaves, but I'm only effective in slightly under two, i.e. I can really only sing in my effective range. I can *reach* the outer limits of the larger range but I can't sustain pitch accuracy or handle any considerable length of melody. Again, regardless of her range, she's proved many times over that she is effective in most of her range. Vision Of Love remains one of the most remarkable vocal performances I've ever heard. I'd love to hear her sing some of Hildegard von Bingen's music, she's probably the only popular singer who could actually do it with ease. Btw, Billie Holiday was one of the greatest singers yet her full range not broad - some say only about an octave and a half - and she packs more meaning and soul into her renditions than most better-endowed voices. Range is no determinate of anything but boundary conditions, the real news is what gets done within the given range, of course. Again, I think MC is simply phenomenal in that regard. Oh, one word more re: range and I'm gone: Captain Beefheart is also said to have had an enormous vocal range. I love his music too, but he was no MC. )

Hi, Mike: I noticed your message to my talk page. I nominated this for deletion not because I doubted the accuracy or verifiability of the information contained but because I doubted the subject's notability. Wikipedia has strict guidelines with respect to whether a living person is notable enough to pass our notability requirements, and one of those guidelines requires in-depth coverage of the person in multiple reliable sources that are completely independent of the subject. So for instance, in your case if you could find in-depth reviews of you or your work in newspapers, magazines, reliable websites (not blogs, unless they're affiliated with a newspaper or magazine) or some other media that isn't related to or created by you and has editorial supervision, that would satisfy the requirements. Unfortunately, nothing that you have created yourself - your Twitter feed, your Facebook or Myspace pages, your website - is considered either a reliable or an independent source for Wikipedia's purposes.

Please note that this is a discussion for deletion, not a speedy deletion. I chose this option because this type of discussion takes seven days to grind its way toward completion, so that gives you seven days to find the independent, reliable third-party sources that Wikipedia requires.

Wikipedia also strongly discourages autobiographies: I invite you to read our guidelines on autobiography to find out why.

If you have any questions about whether a source is reliable or not, please feel free to write back on my talk page. Thanks!",0

 One small nit pick- 

In this paragraph:

A minority of theorists, such as Wendy B. Faris, argue that certain films, such as The Witches of Eastwick and Field of Dreams could be described as magical realist, but the term is still primarily used to describe literature.
However, if one accepts movies as a possible medium for magic realism, one should have a look at many of the movies of Tim Burton (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish) or David Lynch (Mulholland Drive, Wild At Heart).
Other examples: La cité des enfants perdus, What Dreams May Come, Adaptation and Being John Malkovich.

These following movies (listed above) are BASED ON BOOKS:
The Witches of Eastwick, Field of Dreams and What Dreams May Come.

It's also silly to wonder if movies can be magical realist, esp if it's based on books that are magical realist books.

Hello Errantx,

Please reconsider these record cover image mistaken deletions because they are generally free for public reproduction in all media.

Also Wikipedia have hundereds or thousands of similar record cover images in their pages including these very same images !
So could you please help by arranging to reinstate all these images asap...

3237,"The article should be unprotected on 25 October . After the article published on Le Monde newspaper , it's been recalled on the French talk page that hiding specific dimensions of a topic is considered WP:POV . The current montage doesn't even show the actual city, only a collection of lifeless landmarks close-ups. For the matter, this has raised enough concerns in France for the story to be also mentioned on a major radio, Europe 1 . This is why, I believe the better way to calm things out is to go for the conservative option which is to use the same image in the English version than the one used in the French version. An image which is a good consensus as it does show the Eiffel Tower, the undisputed symbol of the city, but also its urban surrounding landscape and its full dimension as a metropolis. That's the only way in my humble opinion to reach WP:NPOV in this case.",0

Perhaps he was serious as in the Bogdanov Affair, but whether or not it is a spoof, the content of that publication is at best numerology.  i'll let this sit for a couple days to see what other input there is, but the fact that Eddington said this stuff is, in fact, numerology (whether he was serious or not) and the article needs to say it.",0

Again, please stop trying to justify inclusion of Original research into the article. As has been pointed out consistently, making a claim that a prop displayed on a fictional television programme is a particular brand of product, not explicitely presented in the content of the show, is outside the scope of Wikipedia. Such claims are tantamount to fancruft which should be saved for fansites. The additional of a """"citation"""" for the Apple II based on blog does not qualify as a Reliable source: At the other end of the reliability scale lie personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, which are not acceptable as sources.  The particular blog entry in fact makes a contrary statement that """"the button-pressing mystery — which has shackled Locke's destiny to an Apple IIE...""""

 Adminship 

You have been active for more than a year, have not been blocked, have made more than 10,000 edits, and are active both in articles and project-space.  You should consider running for adminship.

I should warn you that Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jeremy Issacharoff (2nd nomination) may come to haunt you in a hypothetical RFA.  Let's compare your nomination to mine:

 Who were the original members and what did they play? 

I am unable to be sure who the original members of the band were, how many they were, and what instruments they playe. Even sifting through the opening section leaves me with some uncertainty, although para 2 tells me the original drummer. I know this is a voluntary project, and I'm grateful for there being any info at at all. Nonetheless, after reading the first paragraph I'm unable to answer basic questions like this.

The opening says: """"The Jesus and Mary Chain originally revolved around the songwriting partnership of its two main members, plus third founding member, bass player Douglas Hart. In the early days, Reid's guitar would be left out of tune, while Hart's bass guitar only had two strings""""

Who were those two main members? What did they play? One Reid (which one?) plays guitar ... does the other play guitar too? Two main members plus third found member - this implies to me that it was a 3 piece band. Was it? Was the original drummer mentioned in para 2 the other """"main member""""?

In 1930, Balbo also did not fly into St. Petersburg, Mumbai or Ho Chi Minh City, because those cities were not called that in 1930 either.

I wonder if you in Wikipedia would be so good as to handle this very delicate matter where 15 young people were killed by an arsonist.
 
I sent you the attached note for the TWO pictures that were in the Wikipedia article: one picture has been removed by someone, despite the artist's express permission to publish (see the attached email from the artist).
 
The missing picture is the following:
  
I stuck the numbers on the photo of the picture to identify the individuals killed  a considerable solace to the families involved. The individuals are numbered in the text to identify them. The original identifications were by one of the mothers of the deceased.
 
If it is difficult for you to reload the picture, I can reload it on Wikipedia and refer to the artist's authority that is attached to this email. Please advise me if you wish me to do this.

I understand now that I should forward to you the authority of the original artist to publish a photo of a picture on Wikipedia. 
 
This picture is shown in two forms on the Wiki page that I have worked on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childers_Palace_Backpackers_Hostel_fire
 
As you will see from the narrative of the arson attack that killed 15 youngsters this is a very sensitive issue. The families are indebted to the Australian artist Jo Palaitis for the memorial  which is now available in Wikipedia.

Speedy deletion of The outlyers
 A tag has been placed on The outlyers requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

This is bull-shit. Mainframe is still IBM's most profitable branch (literally billions of dollars earned), because banks and governments would never accept the inherent unreliability of PC-farms. Also, PC based clusters simply cannot have the vast I/O performance, traditional to mainframes, which these big brothers require.

I didn't say that the summary= attribute is not working; I said that it was marked as obsolete. Obsolete in this instance means that browsers claiming compliance with HTML 5 need not support it, and people writing pages that claim compliance with HTML 5 should not use it. But most browsers that support HTML 5 also support HTML 4, not just because it will take a long time for everybody with a website to rewrite the content for HTML 5 (if it ever happens: there are still a lot of HTML 2.0 or 3.2 compliant pages out there that would fail a conformance check for HTML 4, let alone HTML 5), but also because HTML 5 has not yet reached the W3C Recommendation stage, so the current stable standard is HTML 4.01.
On some discussion pages (I know of at least three threads outside of User talk: space) there is a scaremonger going around telling people to stop using the  element ASAP, because it's marked as obsolete in HTML 5. Don't panic: it still works in every browser I've tried it in though, and will probably do so for a long time yet.   07:42, 28""",0

 Welcome to visit Obrides Wedding Dress & Evening Dress Factory.

Obrides was born in 2006. Before 2010, Obrides mainly did business with wholesalers from all over the world and didn't produce dresses. All our dresses are bought from other factories, so the dresses quality and delivery time can not be controlled by us. In this case, we decided to set up our own factory, so that we can provide better service and dresses quality. In March, 2010, the New Obrides was born. In the first week of March 2010, first hundreds of wedding dresses has been delivered to our wholesalers, who would like to place more orders to New Obrides.

Now, we do wholesale business and retail business and provide OEM service. Our products include wedding dresses & gowns, evening dresses, flower girl dresses and wedding accessories. In recent years, we have delivered dresses to almost all countries and now more and more customers contact us to order their dreamed dresses. What are you waiting for? Please just contact us if you need any dress.

I agree that it is a heritage stucture of significance. So is All Saint Church, Trimulgherry. This church has even recived the INTACH award from the erstwhile HUDA and ASI. Why then am I not insisting on including the following pictures in the article?

If you are insist on including a picture that you think is of real importance to the article, I will also insist on adding the above two pictures which I believe are of great importance as well. The point I am trying to make is that the article Secunderabad discusses several aspects of Secunderabad and not just architecture. The number of pictures in each section should be proportionate to the length of that section. We have enough pictures for the section on architecture. A mention and description of important structures should suffice.
As for the other pictures you have pointed out. I beleive the picture of Garden restaurant has nothing to do with advertisement. The restaurant is a local landmark and is therefore of significance. Pictures of locally famous restaurants are often featured in wikipedia articles about cities. Refer Cafe du Monde picture in New Orleans. The Tankbund road picture is also significant. It is an important thoroughfare in the city which acts as the main arterial road that connects the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderaabd. As for the Parade Grounds picture, I'm not contesting its significance or insignificance. However it doesn't hurt to keep the picture. I hope I cleared things up a bit. Thanks",0

You are just trying to bully your way into getting what you want, but you already lost consensus, so you're not going to get it anyway.

And speaking of bad faith, you claimed you did not oppose redirecting to photo editing yet you blind reverted the change for no reason and left it that way even after the merge was complete AND you insisted upon trying to do more of a merge. Therefore your only so-called justification for the revert no longer holds true. If you want to demonstrate good faith instead of proving bad faith you should have undid your revert so that the article was redirected, per the consensus.

 I agree. I have had a small amount of time this evening to do a little research. This 2010 review  could perhaps help in bridging the void. It states that there is a """"lack of consensus"""" and """"robust evidence"""" within the medical literature for things such as penile cancer, STI and UTI, while maintaining there is evidence for HIV prevention (at least in the African trials). If I had the time I would be tempted to run a statistical analysis on the medical reviews themselves! I suspect there would be a clear correlation betweeen the conclusions reached and the country from which they originated. Which brings us (in my opinion) to the crux of the matter. Rightly or wrongly, this is primarily a ritualistic or cosmetic procedure, regardless of what evidence or opinion the medical community has, or will provide. Therefore, to treat this as almost an entirely statistically based article, while only giving a cursory nod to the ethical debate, just feels wrong to me. I am certainly not advocating any bias either for or against. I would be happy to see quotes from Rabbis, Imams, surgeons and scholars. I also believe that any medical consensus (if proven) should remain the basis of the article. Perhaps a sub-heading of """"controversy"""" may be worthwhile? """,0

 Advice 

I apologize for your recent difficulties, your block was clearly undeserved. Our governance here at Wikipedia is imperfect and too often administrators abuse the power we grant them. While we can’t prevent it we can work around it - in this case by creating a new identity to bypass your block - what we call a """"sockpuppet"""" account. Officially it’s frowned upon but so long as it’s undetected a sockpuppet is just as functional as a regular account. In fact many current and former administrators are sockpuppet accounts. The instructions below provide an easy guide to creating your new account and avoiding detection.

Instructions
 Log out of your Wikipedia account, clear your cookies (google """"how to clear all cookies"""" for instructions) and close your browser
 Download a new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer. This will be your dedicated Wikipedia browser
 Follow these instructions to permanently disable javascript in your new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer
 And these to permanently disable java: All browsers
 Reset your IP address. With most  ISPs the procedure is as follows: unplug your modem, wait 10 minutes, plug it back in. Use this website (http://www.whatsmyip.org/) to check your IP address before and after to verify it's changed. If it has, great, if not you may have to wait a few hours or a few days before repeating this procedure successfully
 Now you're ready to register your new Wikipedia account

Tips
 Never log into your old account from the same network or with the same browser as your new account
 Don't choose an account name similar to your old account name; administrators will use that as an excuse to sanction you
 Don't edit your user page or your talk page straight away; it's a dead giveaway you’re not a new user. Remember, this user is “new” to Wikipedia
 Mess up a little - forget to sign or sign incorrectly, split someone's comment “accidentally” - everything to give the impression this is your first experience editing Wikipedia
 Avoid noticeboards and contentious articles until you’ve made a reasonable number of edits; sockpuppet or not experienced Wikipedians don't appreciate being held to community standards by new users

All done. Happy editing and welcome back. I hope your new experience will be more pleasant.    — John Whales, Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web

Pesky, I love analogies, problem is, they are always tough, to make good ones. (For example, the rising water was threatening to do the Man of Faith in, and it only defeated him, after he stupidly refused aid. Problem is, the rising water, representing a future threat, giving time to make correct decision to accept aid, is passe in this case. The water has already drowned the Man of Faith, before the story begins. The block/threat/damage/drowning, has already taken place, it is not a future threat. Ask yourself if there is a future threat on Peny now that is worse than his present situation. They already """"got him"""", he feels unjustly so, without policy basis.

Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.   Kingshowman""",1

 Good Result 

This is definitely a good result for the Irish Nationalist editors, and the rest of us can learn something fom it. Here's what to do - ignore any debate, misrepresent the results of a vote and act unilaterally, in this case by moving the page (to a totally stupid title) and then obtain the services of a tame admin to move protect it. Well done, HighKing, PurpleArrow and the rest of you. I guess you can go now. It doesn't really matter that it's a daft title, main thing is it doesn't include the words """"British Isles"""", so job done. As for the future, there's some interesting remarks at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Military_history where HighKing et al. have been rightly rebuffed by the people who actually know about these things. Their suggestion is that there's nothing wrong with an article about the military history of the British Isles, so I vote this article is moved back to the title before PurpleArrow moved it.

 Project News
Two new WikiProjects have formed that relate to WP:Films. WikiProject Actors and Filmmakers has been started as a descendant of WP:Films and WP:BIO. The project will help to improve the quality of articles on actors, directors, screenwriters, producers, cinematographers, film editors, and film score composers. WikiProject James Bond also formed this month and will help to improve James Bond films, books, characters, and other related articles. The projects each currently have memberships of 20 users, and are seeking new members. Stop by both of these new projects and see if they interest you.
 We have now reached over 25,000 film articles that have been assessed by our assessment department! Remember to always add the {{Film|class=}} template to a film article's talk page so the project can get a better idea of what work still needs to be done. Below is a table showing a breakdown of our articles by class and importance.
Films without infoboxes have increased from about 2,000 to just over 5,000 films with systematic tagging completed this month. There are also tallies for requested film images (~7,000), articles that need synopsis (~4,100) and articles that need cast section (~400).
 Spotlight Update:  Multiple films and film-related articles have reached GA and FA status in April 2007.
 Fritz the Cat (4/28) Heavy Traffic (4/10)
 Shia LaBeouf (4/14)
 Leslie Nielsen (4/19)
 Battlefield Earth (4/19)
There were also two GA films that were recently delisted. Please help return the articles to their prior GA status.

As a Teo specialist who has looked at much of the Maya literature on the topic, I agree that any talk of a actual military engagement between a force sent from Teo to fight a comparable force at Tikal is speculative at best. That is not to say that it didn't happen, but there is no evidence for it external to the texts from the above-mentioned sites. In the 1990s, of course, these texts were widely interpreted as describing a conflict between Tikal and Uaxactun; this is still reflected on the current version of the Uaxactun page.",0

4469,"I agree with you 
Wikipedia does need to make a review of its policies and role it wants to serve as a web 2.0 encyclopedia. Here was something I said in the talk page of the 'a more perfect union'.

(I believe that most of time the argument is about this main issue of 'Is Wikipedia is being used for publicity?' and NOT an argument about whether it is just an 'Encyclopedia of important events or topics occuring or occured'. I am sure once the presidential race is over, there would be no such argument of the deletion of this article whatsoever, and people discussing about this speech would be doing so solely because of its content, its linguistic delivery, and other reasons solely for historical and educational reasons. Most of the times people are forgotten but what they have done or said makes them remembered. Today there are 350 million google hits for the 'I Have a Dream' speech [3] and 20 million for 'Martin Luther King' [4] but only 2.3 million hits for 'I Have a Dream Martin Luther King' search, [5], suggesting that many people especially in non-American countries perhaps would know the speech but not even knowing who said it in the first place. By contrast there are only 1 million hits for 'A More Perfect Union Barack Obama' [6] 722 thousand hits for 'Barack Obama Speech on Race' [7], but 30 million hits for 'Barack Obama' [8]. My argument is that I implore Wikipedia users to please let go of this dilemna and constant debate of trying to keep Wikipedia non publicity and solely information, because by deleting articles some Wikipedia editors find is adding publicty to one person named Barack Obama, they are also deleting something which is so much potentially informational for many other billions of people who just want information on this particular speech. I say let the people decide how they filter their information, because the election only objectively affects 300 million Americans [9], but the race-issue affects everybody on the planet, and this speech IS a key speech on that matter.Msethisuwan (talk) )",0

Khalid is greatest general of all time, arguably.  Alexander is the second greatest general. For example, compare battle of Nihawand to Guagamela. Archaemenids recovered, Sassanids never recovered. In Yarmouk, Khalid outnumbered 10 to 1 but still victorious! He did not inherit an army, like Alexander's macedonian army from King Philip. He vanquished Persia and devastated Byzantium in 6 years! Plus he was many times outnumbered. None of these factors apply to Napoleon or Hannibal or Alexander. Acknowledge facts and logical truth. Dont become biased because Khalid was a muslim.

Since there are 1000 liters in a cubic meter, you need to multiply by 1000 to convert from cubic meters to liters.  Now if you wanted to use published specs (usually quoted in liters) in the equations provided, you would divide the Vas(liters) by 1000 to get Vas in cubic meters.  Units can be challenging even for engineers, it may help to work through a few examples using published specs to get a handle on things.  Drivers from Peerless, Vifa, Scan Speak and SEAS tend to have very complete parameter sets that make sense using these equations.  Some manufacturers, especially car audio companies, publish specs that are incomplete or inconsistent and will give problems when working through the equations.",0

 Mild humor based on facts or accepted facts being unencyclopedic and worthy of nuking. 

In the intro paragraph to this article, the last two sentences state the following, """"On the DVD commentary for the film one of the commentators claims that George Lucas reassured him that the project would, in twenty years, be seen as a masterpiece. As of the year 2012 the film was still considered one of the worst ever made.""""

I did happen to see this movie ages ago, and I remember how terrible it was, and it does rank as one of the worst I personally ever saw, now whether that this is widely accepted fact or opinion, I'm not exactly sure, but, if the rest of the facts check out, that a DVD commentator did state that Lucas told him that the project would be considered a masterpiece in 20 years, if *that* can be fully verified, should this comment be able to withstand encyclopedic muster?

The previous comment of the article states that MOC was not re-established in 1993, which is a fallacy. The MOC has been legally registered in Montenegro in line with the valid legal system of the state of Montenegro and in line with the laws in Montenegro - which is clearly apparent from the MOC page on Wikipedia. The MOC Church is called the Montenegrin Orthodox Church in its formal registration in Montenegro, so there is no space for speculation here. The Church was re-established after a separate existence until 1920 and a ban by the Serbian (then Yugoslav) autocratic King Aleksandar. 
The article does not claim that MOC is a major branch of Eastern Orthodoxy outside Montenegro. 

The statement """"over 74% of Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""" is anyway a fallacy, as there is no accurate census that can prove this. One may say truthfully say that """"most Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox Christians, most of whom belong to the Serb Orthodox Church"""", but a large number of Montenegrins are atheists, agnostics, or otherwise, myself included. Being a Montenegrin does not mean that you are part of the 74% of Eastern Orthodox Christians. Sorry, this is the 21st century.

You can not just delete the fact that MOC followers claim that """"all of the existing churches in Montenegro were once part of an autonomous Montenegrin Orthodox Church that was abolished following the union with Serbia in 1918."""" This is the explanation why shrines are not being built en masse in Montenegro by the MOC, as it claims to inherit the churches currently in the hands of SOC. If we put only one viewpoint in """"its following is small to the point of non-existence and it has not been recognised by any other Orthodox Church"""" it is not balanced. Also, the statement """"its following is small to the point of non-existence"""" needs to be based on fact not fancy. Do you have an official census of followers or is this your speculation?

 EVHS 

Hi, 

I saw you've been editing the EVHS article.  I wanted to bring a few things to your attention.  The user evhs00 has basically been copying the Los Alamos High School article.  (see for yourself).  Problem is that he's copied a great deal of stuff that does not apply to EVHS.  For instance he makes a serious of false, baseless and dubious claims:

 EVHS was one of Newsweek's 2007 """"1,000 Best High Schools in America"""" (#598).  This was baselessly copied from the LAHS article and is just false when applied to EVHS: 

http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?sort=Rank&count;=1351&Search;=&start;=500&limit;=100&year;=2007&

 EVHS is """"mostly middle class"""".  A dubious claim considering espanola is one of the poorer cities in one of the poorest states and has 21% of its population living beneath the poverty level:

http://www.city-data.com/city/Espanola-New-Mexico.html

 Many other claims are suspect, uncited, and bear a clear similarity to claims on the LAHS article.   

Additionally, 

 The image of the sundevil mascot was taken from the Arizona State University article and is not fair use.

 The image of the basketball team was taken from the EVHS Athletics website and is not fair use. 

Basically there's no citations anywhere and the author's methodology is clearly one of blatant copying.  I really want to avoid an edit-war between rival high school articles so I'm not going to touch the EVHS article.  I'm actually really glad that somebody is working on the EVHS page.  But the author needs to learn how to work within the rules.

 Concerns
Got a message about an hour ago from Professor Obar of the Media and Telecommunication Policy project and I think it is viewed best in full:

Can you please communicate to the online mentors that I DO NOT want them moving student material into the main space for them. This is a big problem. I have noticed that this has happened with a number of the projects already, for example, in the broadband.gov article and the media cross-ownership article. We need the students to be doing this on their own, of course so they can learn how to do it, and also so that I can grade what they've done. How am I supposed to follow student submissions if the data is associated with online mentors? A BIG PROBLEM ALREADY... please help me with this. None of you responded to my post about this on the discussion page. This is about to get out of hand. Jaobar (talk) 

With that, of course, please only give instructions on how to move, don't do it for them.  Please only let them know what to do and let them do it themselves.  If they run into problems, provide further instructions.  Do not it for them.  This seems to be making a mess of Prof. Obar's grading system and I would like to avoid that.  Thanks. -  • Talk • Coor.

Aryan Anarchism
My dear   I was wondering if you could explain your behaviour. First you remove the section on Aryan Anarchism with the comment """"(xenophobic marxism etc - not notably anarchist sorry deletinh 'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right)"""",. The section was restored with an addition to the section discussing Aryan Anarchism on the talk page inviting you to explain your somewhat bizarre comment. Bearing in mind Lala Hardayal's prominent position as an academic philosopher and Stanford University, involvement with the IWW and eventual departure from the USA following his arrest for his anarchist activities, your suggestion that the piece is not notably anarchist is hard to understand. This is compounded by your final quip """"'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right"""". Perhaps you could explain why you regard the self-organisation of migrants against repressive immigration control? For that is certainly a feature of tehir involvement with the voyage of the Komagata Maru. Is it odd that this movement, as with every other anarchist movement, throws up contradictions. I think not! Did not Peter Kropotkin throw in his lot with Tzar and encourage Russians fight Germans as a war against the state. Was not Pierre-Joseph Proudhon a patriotic anti-communist noted for his sexist attitude to women. His anti-semitism is matched by that of the pan slavic nationalist, Bakunin.

There is only x86 drivers right now, but I can assure you that X86 drivers can run in Windows X64, provided they do not run in Kernel mode. Presumably, this driver is User mode, which Microsoft allows. It is also unsigned, but Windows X64 installed it anyway (proving it couldn't be x64 because Windows won't install 64 bit drivers unsigned. I can give some screenshots proving this.

About serb radical nationalist editors

Hi, I’m posting this anonymously because I don’t want to be annoyed with more and more attacks on my talk page (and the head-aching duty to answer each accusation).

Anyway, I’ve been editing Wikipedia from some years on, and it seems like there is a very strong SRS-like Cabal here in this encyclopedia that have been able to put their very distorted vision of Yugoslav history, persons and wars in practically all of the articles related to these themes. It’s disturbing.

If someone read Wikipedia articles related to Yugoslav Wars and base solely on them as a source of research (as many and many students in US and around the world do today), he or she will """"learn"""" that """"the """"Holy Serbs were victims, the USA/NATO/Albanian/Croats/Muslims ere the villains, and a great injustice was made to the innocent Holy Serb population that never made anything wrong in History but to defend themselves from the aggressors"""".

This is gross revisionism of one of the worst atrocities of Europe in the second half of 20th century. It's like to put the blame of the Holocaust on Poland and the Jewish people rather then on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.

But the most incredible thing is that this radical nationalist vision are winning the game here in Wikipedia. The SRS Cabal editors use extreme pressure, group action and extreme edit techniques (and they're not usually caught on Wikipedia anti-edit war barriers, since they act as a collectivity) they are imposing their vision without constraints. People who try to question them or make any kind of edit that contradicts their rhetoric are hardly harassed in their Talk Pages and the talk Pages of the articles. 

And what is worse of all, thy use the Administration of Wikipedia and the rules of Wikipedia  to achieve their goals.

These people know very well the functioning of the tools of power and management in Wikipedia, and they use this knowledge to pressure, to block, and finally to silent editor who defy the radical nationalist ideology. Like many other authoritarian organizations, they use collective organized pressure to neutralize individual dissenters. And they go unpunished.

I’m saying this because I've been visiting many user pages of people who have been tried to make more balanced articles about Yugoslav matters here in Wikipedia, and when I saw their Talk pages I generally saw infinite hellish arguments with editor from the SRS-like Cabal, many adverts, many blockings… and many editor who simply ceased to edit anymore because all of this.

Sadly, I don't know what to do. I would like very much to find a way to counter-balance these editors, but I don't know how.  I've been thinking like to catch up people who share my visions and found something like a """"Pro-Accuracy Anti-Serb-Radical Group"""", but I don't know how to make this, since if something alike would be created somehow here inside Wikiepdia, it would be shut down in minutes by the SRS-like Cabal trough their well-known techniques.

Do you know any way to solve this Gordian Knot? If you have any ideas, please anwser here. I'll get back to read it. Best Regards.""",0

A tag has been placed on Loot monkeys, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

 Long reply I'm afraid - hope it's helpful.

 It's possible - no people are flawless. But in fact it very rarely happens. I've been asked to investigate about 6 or so cases this last 9 months, by Irpen, Giano, Bishonen, at RFAR, on ANI, and others, but in most of those - in fact all but one or two in a nine month period, the channel actually functioned exactly as one would wish it to. The one case it didn't, I myself reported in full to the community at ANI, with full summary of the IRC dialog, so that it was made public in detail (a blocked admin had sought an unblock on dubious grounds, another admin had unblocked trusting that without sufficiently checking for themselves). 

 The problem with using """"IRC!"""" as a smokescreen is, those who go there know in fact it's extremely rare, so naturally it loses credibility and is seen as a way to further a """"politicized"""" agenda by those who have bad memories of IRC from years ago. We have an agreed structure to address problems in the channel, yet """"for whatever reason"""" those who feel there is a problem never actually come to me (or any channel operator) to have it resolved. They instead pass logs round, a move guaranteed to shed more heat, but not actually solve the problem. That to me says a lot; a person genuinely with a concern would ask to discuss it, and aim for resolution, just like any other dispute. These cases though are never used for dispute resolution, but only ever for dispute escalation. That seems to say something. 

 As for your specific question, again, yes, it's possible. But unlikely. Administrators, who undergo a quite strict and probing debate over their conduct and understanding of wiki-attitudes, are quite a varied bunch. They include diverse views - Bishonen, Lar, Coren, 1==2, myself, Carcharoth, to name but a few at random in this context. Any and all admins can go to that channel, and some 60 - 70 users on average are regularly there at any given time. They cover extreme diverse views too - to the point that no one stance can get much if any of a toehold there if it isn't proper. There will always be strong voices around. 

 RFA candidates will not be """"representative of the community as a whole"""". The community includes many vandals for example, under-represented at RFA, and many who understand policy well (probably over-represented at RFA). What is possible to say is, the users at #en-admins are probably representative of those users the community has deemed sufficiently trustworthy in judgement and clued in on wiki ethos, to use the tools. This shows in a few ways  for example, an outburst by a user (rare in itself) will often be addressed by general refusal to endorse it, and letting one or two users speak for everyone, or resolving in private chat to actually educate people how to handle things better, and that works very well. On-wiki, you'd get more people inclined to shout than fix. En-admins as a channel tends to look to fix problems by resolving them. When problems are visible, they get addressed. 

 They're also rather long suffering and (I suspect) used to the idea that bad faith will exist no matter what they say or do, and used to having their words pored over in a manner that nobody else would expect on-wiki, and misrepresented if necessary to create smoke. That's not ideal. It's a bit dysfunctional, as it encourages others to stir up problems that have little to no merit, make a large noise over a tiny number of tiny matters (major drama, someone used a bad word once and then when corrected by others agreed it was wrong a few minutes later, for example), to shout rather than approach those who might help, and so on. That kind of foolishness and """"hype"""" helps nobody.

 Lastly, it's worth noting that critically minded users play a very valuable role in that they can approach channel operators if they have concerns, on the spot, or indeed speak up in the channel. When they do, if it's merited, it is usually supported, and would indeed be the best way to effect disapproval or correction. I strongly encourage this, because I greatly suspect the number of cases that would be raised and found genuine would be very small, and they should be raised openly in the channel when noticed. But they probably only happen extremely rarely. To take an extreme case, suppose someone is present, believes an action is wrong, but says nothing, does nothing, and instead complains to a third party (non admin) who lacks all knowledge, but whom they encourage in a belief they have been conspired against. And all the time not broaching it in the channel, nor to any of the channel operators who have made their names known for exactly this purpose last month. This does the community a disservice. Such matters should be named openly to channel users, or privately to channel operators, if they are felt",0

 Comment 

My comments on Malleus' talk page were well beyond civil, even for a user talk page. They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction. 

For the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to """"bait"""" or """"poke"""" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. 

I lost respect for Malleus when he said, """"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick."""" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.

But my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. 

It's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.

With regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.

I'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that """"we don't care if we offend our readers."""" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.

And finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and """"sex tape"""" and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.

The tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the """"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard"""" type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked """"Should we mention the tape?"""" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.

And it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it. 

Although Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.

Psycho states that his favorite guitarists that influence his own style are Corey Beaulieu, Kirk Hammett, Dave Mustaine, Robb Flynn and Andy LaRocque. Also, he states that Robb Flynn, Matt Heafy and Phil Anselmo have influences his vocal style. Obie cites Oliver Palotai of Kamelot as a favorite keyboardist. As influences on his vocal style he mentions Brandon Boyd of Incubus and Roy Khan of Kamelot. Rob cites Robert Trujillo of Metallica as an influence and Cioky names John Dolmayan of SOAD as a favorite drummer. Sethgar has named Daron Malakian, also of SOAD as a favorite guitarist.
The band plays a blend of multiple genres of metal: metalcore, thrash metal, gothic metal, industrial metal and death metal, but they don't always put all the styles into a single song. They rather blend two or three of these styles into one song, making it difficult for their songs to be catalogued as a specific genre.

He is also an official member of the """"You Tube Deletion Committee"""" started by Dmcdeviti.e., has an admitted bias/ego investment in something other than editing this article.

He clearly has ZERO idea what """"disruptive"""" means, as on-topic good faith editorial opinions on talkpages are never disruptiveor perhaps he does know and is trying to bully??? NHN, on the other hand, is in fact participating in a project which is disrupting Wikipedia to make a point; has certainly had a decidedly and idiotically disruptive effect on this article, in my experienced judgement.  My feeling is that they can get lost and stay lost, or we can take it to a higher level.  They are not editors of this article, they have categorically refused to engage in discussion on the talkpage of this article while making edits they know are disputed, and they do NOT have consensus on policy pagesconsensus is against them. What they lack in consensus they have tried to compensate for with bullying (which disgusts me).

 Reverts new changes while it's being added and still edited 
Reverts changes all around, no discussion before taking action. Claims I removed/blanked stuff in S.M.A.R.T article. False claim as proven by edit history. I added HDDScan, then changed style to match the rest of the table. That doesn't constitute blanking an article or removing data.
See comment below """"I don't know what program you're using, but it is clearly not functioning properly"""".

Suggest to author to switch to less trigger happy program. Sorry about the previous remark since it's clearly your automated revertion script that's trigger happy not you.

Also claimed """" never provided any edit summary describing your changes"""" As you can see my first edit had """"+HDDScan"""" which meant """"adding hdd scan"""". So the change was described. Further minor edit of changing a color of a column that I just added to match the rest needs no long descriptions as it's obvious to anyone bothering to press the compare button. 

Reverting without looking at what's being reverted is vandalism.

(Edit history typo fix: """"Stated that I did describe my first article changes"""" -> """"Stated that I didn't describe my first article changes"""") As you can see I makes small errors at times, the edit button is there to fix this.

 Patrick - You can help in wherever you see needed improvement to D.C. United articles, and help one of the primary goals, which is to make the main Wikipedia entry on United an FA. From what JonBroxton has said, he's dead on. We should emulated the style of writing and content used in the Sounders FC entry. It's written in American English, and has numerous sub-pages that are also featured articles and or lists. 
 JonBroxton - I completely agree. The Sounders FC entry is easily one of the strongest MLS-related entries on Wikipedia. The American English style of writing and the specific angle focused on the American version of the game. And by """"league-specific"""", I'm presuming you mean the MLS Cup Playoffs, the """"regular season"""", and how the playoffs are not a cup tourney but rather a culmination of the regular season?

Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  

Now Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things? No.  You fucked up.

 Dear Leslie fyans, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia! I hope to not seem unfriendly, but I'd like to bring to your attention the conflict of interest guideline which explains the potential incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral, verifiable encyclopedia, and the purposes of an individual editor. Conflict of interest editing often involves contributing to Wikipedia in order to promote yourself, your friends or family, or the interests of other individuals, companies, or groups you are closely associated with. When an editor disregards the aims of Wikipedia to advance outside interests, they stand in a conflict. Please review this guideline, and you may wish to also review the notability guidelines as well. Thank you for your interest in Wikipedia, and I hope you'll find many helpful areas! Sincerely, Ariel♥Gold 
Hi Leslie, I'm placing this here for your review, as your submission to articles for creation was specifically about yourself. Also please see Wikipedia:Autobiography, along the same lines. Normally if you are notable enough, reliable, third-party sources will exist, and an article will have been written. If you are notable (again refer to the notability requirements), but the article does not exist, you may request it, but either way, you should not edit an article about yourself, as explained above, as it would be quite difficult to remain neutral, which is one of the core policies of Wikipedia. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks! Ariel♥Gold """,0

I assume good faith on your part, UserQuiddity, because you have always been a gentleman. Accordingly either you are mistaken, or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism, because the facts, as I know them are substantially different from your presentation. The page in question is Jewish Bolshevism, which is a so called noun + adjetive expression (according to Wikipedians). The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him. The insult was his own deduction. I did not hurl at him any insult. And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity. I am not allowed to name any of the people I suspect - what's that word, I don't know, and I do not wish to waste my time looking for it - it sounds something like suckpoper - can you help me out on this?

Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. 

While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.

Also I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states 

""""The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names""""  (i.e. not """"must"""" be) 

It further clarifies the point (with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line)...

Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3).

Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as """"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place""""... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...

Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

Notice the words """"and should be used in articles with caution"""". I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)

I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)
  
I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)

Comments on your work as administrator

Now that the dust has cleared a bit, I thought it fitting to give you some feedback on the events of a couple of days ago. Do you know what a kyosaku is? In the zendo, when you """"lose your mind"""", you can request to be struck on the shoulder with a bamboo stick, to recover your alertness. Even if unrequested, I consider the block you imposed on me as a kyosaku, a welcome reminder not to let emotions get the better of me. After all, Wikipedia practice is very much like zen practice: You have to drop your ego to write well, and if done well the writing itself cuts ego further.

Paradoxically, however, that good effect came out of an action that was not so good. It came from an abuse of power, by you against me. When I am dealing with another user who laces his edits with vulgarities and ad hominem attacks, what I expect from the administrators is not one-sided, vindictive reactions, even if for a moment I lose my temper, but even-handed action that restores order and helps everyone maintain the focus on the writing. I am disappointed that you were not able to provide that this time around. I hope that this has been a learning experience for you as it has been for me, and that in the future our interaction will be more constructive than it has been so far.

Undo the merge!

It isn't going to happen.  Collectonian (talk · contribs) 

Consensus is not immutable, and this seems like as good a proposal as any.  Let's see what the 
community as a whole has to say.  I'm in favor of it because of the abysmal coverage of the current article.  If, when the old articles are sourced, organized and cleaned up, there is still so little material that it can all be summarized on one page, then it could be merged.  If someone who can still edit the article made a note of this suggestion in the anime sections it would probably be good.  I can do it when the lock is lifted if no one else has. 72.160.96.228  

No it isn't """"as good a proposal as any."""" Its already been covered within the last week that the consensus to merge is valid and that it HAS consensus. Get over all ready, gravy. You hate it so damn much, go to the DB wikia.  Collectonian (talk · contribs) 

Since this whole mess started I've been contributing over there regularly.  It's nice to be part of a worthwhile project.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem like that's what this part of Wikipedia is anymore. 207.118.67.139

A few comments:
72.160.96.228, you have said at least twice that you've worked on the DB articles in the past. However, your contributions show you've only ever edited this talk page - have you previously edited under a username or a different IP address?
Many of you who disagree with the merge are complaining about """"deleted"""" material. I would like to stress that unless an entire article gets deleted, all information is still present in its history. The DVD info that people are complaining was properly sourced but got deleted anyways? Guess what, it's still there (at least, I assume that's the information you're complaining about, it's the only DVD tables I could find in any page history).
The merge can be undone if a given section gains a sufficient amount of properly sourced, nontrivial information. Because of the close relationship of the Dragon Ball manga and the DB and DBZ anime (and, to a lesser extent, DBGT), it's doubtful this will ever happen, but it's still a possibility.
You're also complaining about the amount of information that got """"lost"""" in the merge. Once again, it's not gone for good, all the information is still present in page histories, and furthermore, you've been told multiple times that you're welcome to properly source the material and add it back in as appropriate. Granted, at the moment the article is semi-protected, but you can still post reliably sourced info on the talk page to be added into the article by a registered user, or you can register for your own account and not have to wait for either the protection to expire or someone else to add the info.
KojiDude made a comment about everyone being lazy. I certainly can't speak for everyone, but I am lazy, and yet I'm still taking the time to write out this response to several complaints.

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.

Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't.

Our First Amendment gives us the right to start a blog and publish whatever we wish to say about anybody.  It is much easier to be critical than correct. 
 
The freedoms we enjoy in the U.S are wonderful but they are also very dangerous. To create an unfavorable impression, it is not necessary that what is said be true.  The damage is done in the mere telling of it.  No one has felt that sting more than I. Last year, the Mail On Sunday falsely reported Andrew Morton paid me to dig up dirt on Tom Cruise, which could not be further from the truth.  The editors finally got around to making the correction.

 Since I won't be around to implement this - do with it as you will. 

I have written up, what I think would be a working compromiseand was going to post it on Mcshithead's talk page but since he has been such an asshole and will never collaborate with another view... trouble is he runs the place and is so afraid of me he is shitting his pants with every word I write...LOL, and you have had your pee-pee slapped because McGod is afraid of you too.

Anyway here goes.

 Compromise. I can understand almost all the views of most people's concerns, here. As a compromise, to most, I would like to offer a possible solution to address most of those concerns for this otherwise conundrum:
 Extend Andreasegde's Triangular Diplomacy II solution from 2011! Before  anybody freaks-out, please read the rest. This solution  would continue to promote the usage of pronoun references to band names, mid-sentence while still retaining the ability to occasionally use the band's name or individual member references, mid-sentence. Complaints about the usage of all pronouns making boring, repetitive, prose in the article would be addressed by  adding this addendum to the previous Triangular Diplomacy II solution, already observed by many.
 Mid-sentence usage of  both, """"The Beatles"""" and """"the Beatles"""" be permitted, occasionally with these caveats:
Provided an identifying phrase is used to indicate usage, 
 When referring to band members,  a lowercase """"t"""" should be used ie. """"the Beatles"""",
 when referring to the band, as a corporate whole,  an uppercase """"T"""" should be used. ie. """"The Beatles"""".

 Some Examples:
 """"The Beatles were a rock band of great accomplishment."""" = capitalisation is always used at the beginning of a sentence, regardless.
 """"Paul became a Beatle"""" = obvious individual (non-group) reference, no """"the"""" or identifying phrase needed.
 """"Paul became one of the most popular members of The Beatles band"""" = whole group reference with """"band"""" identifier and also obvious context.
 """"Paul became one of most long-lived members of The Beatles band"""" = group reference with """"band"""" identifier and obvious context.
 """"George Martin became involved with The Beatles group later."""" = """"group"""" clarifies corporate group usage meaning.
 """"After the event the individual Beatles went separate  ways"""" = """"individual"""" clarifies individual member context.
 """"After the event the Beatles individuals went separate  ways"""" = """"individuals"""" clarifies.
 """"After the event The Beatles members went separate  ways"""" = members clarifies the band/group. (a gotcha').
 If people have other extreme examples, perhaps we can see them in order to fine tune and clarify to satisfy almost all collaborative editors.
This solution could resolve most of the concerns stated in this medcom proceding. Future editing from newer editors may violate these seemingly complicated rules but would be easy to fix with addition of either simple words or cap correction and a references to some posted (MOS?) rules. The only arguments (I can see) that may arise would be whether the band or the individual members are being referred to. The simple fix, for these disputes, would be to return that particular sentence back to the Triangular Diplomacy solution. This would appear to be inline with hundreds of other musical articles already observing a similar de facto standard. Any violations would be easy to correct and violations would not look outside of most grammar usage anyway. I don't really see any other way to satify so many different concepts, here. Trademarks don't work and the MOS contradicts itself and grammar in many places.
If this solution is even remotely desired by the majority, and/or medcom team, here, this could be fine tuned by controlled input to medcom  mediators. Also implementation methods for clarifying to newcomers would need input on how to set up the MoS page, possibly. Beyond my knowledges. This MoS should apply to all musical articles, if we can make it work.
Have a nice life! If I am still here in a few hours Iwill drop back in harrass the crap out of you some more! ROFL!

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's. 

Fuck Black Dahlia Murder, I'm not giving up....this is insane, I'm not letting you mother fuckers take away the one thing I have that you haven't ruined.""",1

The """"senior"""" is a direct quote from the cited source, the 2005 Wired article 
SmartWater CEO Phil Cleary, a retired senior detective, hit upon the idea after watching burglars he had apprehended walk free from court due to lack of evidence.
Usually Wired magazine is considered a reasonably reliable source. But since the fact in question is not very important in the context of this Wikipedia article, I am just going to remove it.

4792,""":, please consider my beer analogy again.  It would be quite easy to find reliable sources saying that beer is made from malt, hops, yeast, and water.  Many people think this is the only way true beer should be made.  Nevertheless some people do make beer out of other ingredients.  Now it might be correct to say that 'traditional ale' is made only of these ingredients and it is certainly true that beer made according to the """"Bavarian Purity Law"""" should be made from only these ingredients.  

Is there no way you can temper your claim and also make it strictly more accurate and informative by saying something like 'traditional Korean kimchi is always fermented'.   

To:User:Martin Hogbin: Look. I would do it if it were true to my knowledge and/or there existed some reliable sources to confirm that. The saveur.com article, the only source against my claim that I consider at least semi-reliable, says """"It can also be eaten before it is allowed to ferment"""". Do you think this confirms the existence of unfermented kimchi against all sources I gathered? Someone might like to have a bite of Sauerkraut before it is fermented. 
I don't want to argue with you or something, but I have heard that beer is made from only malt, hops, and water in Germany (as it should be). Unfortunately, at least in Korea, Japan, and the U.S., most beer includes rice, potato, corn starch, and many other ingredients I think unnecessary. At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.
But kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled """"unfermented"""", maybe except for Japanses """"kimuchi"""" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.) Nevertheless, I am willing to temper my claim if editors can find even a couple of reliable sources that say some kimchi is unfermented.

Proposed Controversy Section

1, I requested administrator assistance because of user mongo's unrelenting deletion of anything I post, including a NPOV Template at the top of the article...he removed it within minutes...the template states it should not be removed until the issues are discussed and resolved.
2, I'm simply proposing a Controversy Section, or any separate section, with the following.
Outside Magazine revealed Kellogg used the """"powerful steroid dexamethasone"""" for an Everest speedclimb attempt.http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/Climbings-Little-Helper.html
The above 'powerful steroid dexamethasone' is in the subtitle of the article, and the paragraph on Kellogg is about 30 paragraphs from the top.
3, I'm open to different wording.
4, Mongo objected to this with various personal objections about the climber.  Mongo did not propose other wording, or any other alternative.  Instead he deleted it within minutes, and did not suggest discussing it, nor would tolerate any discussion.  Isn't this a violation of wikipedia conduct?
5, Fact:  National media Outside Magazine did an article on the matter, it's a critical article, and the journalist did a paragraph on Kellogg's use of the prescription drug on Everest.
I will try to find other mention of Kellogg's use of the drug...there is mention of it at his sponsor's blog Outdoor Research.

He, first and foremost, wants to greatly thank   for their kindness in the matter, and also said that DGG made up outrageous lies. He is greatly concerned that DGG is an editor, as some of his remarks were so grammatically incorrect on talk pages. He can also confirm that he has not been involved in any sort of blogging on bullying and he can also confirm that he has never been an author. Mr. Pettersen would also like to know if there is a more senior administrator that he can bring the matter up with, as DGG has been so extremely disrespectful. We can completely confirm that the past articles about David Pettersen were never about the David Pettersen that is currently running for school board.

289,"""::The purpose of this discussion on the proposed intervening section is to illuminate the controversial conclusions and impression that readers took away from the story, because they conflated the reported claims of the DI as described in the story with independently verifiable facts.  The analysis by  Skip Evans illustrates this confusion and provides a reliable source that the claims of the DI are not necessarily valid.  That's one way to establish the controversial nature of stories about the DI which contrast the published claims of the DI to published remarks by signatories like Salthe and Davidson ridiculing the DI's interpretation.

If you want a reliable source that the article by Chang is controversial in its own right, on multiple points, you can take a look at the article's Ask Science Q&A; page on the NYT wherein Chang responds to commentary and criticisms of his piece, and admits that parts of it are slanted toward highlighting the anti-evolution signers and not the pro-evolution ones.  Chang says, """"This article focused on Discovery's petition and thus I did not interview evolution supporters.""""

Elsewhere, you have good evidence that there are evolution supporters among the 103 initial and subsequent signers, notably including Bob Davidson, whose story came to light and is featured in the main Wikipedia entry on the Darwin Dissent Controversy.

This intentional snubbing of evolution-supporters among those interviewed by Chang for comments misleads readers about the statistical mix of those who signed the petition, giving some people the impression (per the desires of the DI) that all signers are variously """"anti-evolution"""" or """"Darwin dissenters.""""  The contemporaneous analysis by Skip Evans reinforces that element of the controversy.

When one realizes that Chang focused the story on the anti-evolution signers (many of whom joined after DI went public, and when one observes that Chang fails to solicit a quote from Picard (even though he mentions her name), one is left wondering which side of the fence she (and others of the 103) reside on.  The purpose of all this is to cast doubt on the unverified presumption (suggested by the existing section which I am forbidden from touching) that Picard belongs to the anti-evolution dissenters.  In other words, I am saying that some of the Wikipedia editors evidently fell into the trap which the DI set, luring readers into believing that all 103 scientists adhered to DI's dubious characterization of them.  

The length of the intervening piece needs to be longer than the section it precedes, because the current section adopts without proof the thesis that Picard is among those belonging to the anti-evolution dissenters.  The proposed intervening section is designed to examine the evidence for the unproven thesis adopted in the existing section and determine whether the evidence for it is credible or conclusive.  As you well know, a proof is typically longer than the theorem.  What's in the proposed intervening section is an examination of the omitted proof, in which the outcome appears to be that the missing proof does not seem to exist, and in fact there is good evidence at hand that the dubious thesis adopted by the existing section is simply false (and therefore unprovable).  If it is false, then it is also potentially libelous. Therefore, establishing the truth or falsehood of the thesis is crucial in order to protect Wikipedia from inadvertently publishing false and defamatory material that slipped through the filters intended to examine the evidence with a keenly skeptical eye.

What any Wikipedia editor happens to know for a fact about the status of the petition in the intervening years is not evidence that anyone whose name appeared in nationally printed ads back in 2001 had the slightest inkling of what the DI was up to in the meantime.  Perhaps Wikipedia editors found this out by doing painstaking research on the DI.  Stanley N. Salthe said in 2006 in the Times article we are examining that he had never heard of the DI.  That's well-sourced evidence that some of those who signed had no clue that the DI even existed, let alone was maintaining a growing list of names.  Therefore one cannot draw any verifiable conclusions about what most of the 103 original signers knew of the DI prior to the 2006 Times story.  

One of the reasons the story is controversial is because it fails to point out that the DI had reprised and evolved a 2001 petition that predated any of the disputed assertions regarding its inherent meaning or its re-interpretion as a testimonial in favor of DI's political agenda.

The two sources which establish the controversial nature of the story are the above mentioned [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/0",0

 Review comments 

I took a brief look at the article after the recent peer review was closed. Here are a few comments for improvement - these are things that woulkd be a problem if this were up for WP:FAC or even WP:GAN.
The lead is five paragraphs but WP:LEAD says the limit is four paragraphs.
The lead does not summarize the article well - my rule of thumb is to include every section in the lead somehow, but the Munic Crisis, his marriage and children, his children with other women, and his death are not in the lead
WP:MOSQUOTE says that all direct quotations need to have a reference (even if they are in the lead)
To be free, most historic images need to have been published before 1923 or their source must be given so clearly that it can be determined that the image was published without a copyright notice or its copyright has expired. Images like File:CAL CAM2 DH4 Nov 4 1926.jpg were clearly taken after 1923, and lack the information as to sources that allow any sort of determination of copyright status.
Or how is this image not still under copyright - published in 1927 at the earliest File:CharlesLindbergh-RaymondOrteig.jpg?
The relevant policy for WP:FAIRUSE images is WP:NFCC, every point of which has to be met for an image to be used under fair use guidelines. I often ask myself three questions about fair use images: 1) Does the image increase the reader's understanding of the article's subject? 2) Is the image discussed in the article itself? 3) Is the image used merely for decorative purposes? NFCC requires minimal use - all of which leads to me to ask: How do two separate Fair Use covers of """"WE"""" increase the reader's understanding / meet minimal use?
MOS says not to sandwich text between images - this does so in several places.
I read Mosely's biography of Lindbergh years ago (it is cited here) and read WE as a kid. This seems to me to under play Lindbergh's isolationism and at least the perception of him as an appeaser / possible Nazi sympathizer. 
The language in the lead at least seems needlessly convoluted - look at what the page Lindbergh says """"Charles Lindbergh (1902–1974), first pilot to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic"""" then look at how it described here """"As a 25-year-old U.S. Air Mail pilot Lindbergh emerged suddenly from virtual obscurity to instantaneous world fame as the result of his Orteig Prize-winning solo non-stop flight on May 20–21, 1927, made from Roosevelt Field[N 1] located in Garden City on New York's Long Island to Le Bourget Field in Paris, France, a distance of nearly 3,600 statute miles (5,800 km), in the single-seat, single-engine purpose built Ryan monoplane Spirit of St. Louis."""" The facts are all there, but it is so comvoluted that if you don't already know what Lindy did, you might miss it.
What makes """"Charleslindberg.com a reliable source? See WP:RS
In short, before you worry too much about the language, there is a lot of other stuff to fix here.

Mutual masturbation has nothing to do with masturbation, it is non-penetrative sex. The word """"masturbation"""" is only used as a euphemism, just because handjob and fingering are similar to the way a male or famale masturbates. Mutual masturbation is actually handjob and fingering, which of course is non-penetrative sex, not masturbation! Mutual masturbation is not about two people sitting opposite to each other and masturbating without touching one another, this is nonsense! If no contact exists, this is simple masturbation, no matter how close two persons are to each other. No contact = Masturbation.

4162,"""This is completely absurd.  Maybe this is the case in the United States, however your northern neighbour makes no such claims.  The Philosophy of Chiropractic far exceeds a modality (manual/mechanical manipulation) and a lesion (vertebral subluxation/joint dyskinesis). It is about a holistic approach to health care using natural therapies primarily (joint manipulation, soft tissue manipulation exercise, nutritional counseling, medical acupuncturestress management, health promotion, ergonomic consulting, etc.  To insinuate that the existence of the profession depends on subluxations is a dated, narrowed view of Contemporary Chiropractic.

Also, anyone who knows a lick of neurology realizes that there neurophysiological effects of manipulation and, similarly, there are neurophysiological effects of joint dyskinesis/subluxation.   However, these are being taken in a neuromusculoskeletal context now as well as possible autonomic implications on visceral functions that may arise from chronic NMS pain syndromes.  This is a contemporary view of the profession.

The title DC or chiropractor certainly does not imply manipulation for subluxation.  Again, a narrowed view focus.  Rather we are holistic NMS doctors with an emphasis on manual therapies and other complementary therapies.  We;re not wannabe MDs or """"glorified PTs"""".  DCs trained in scientific schools are perfectly positioned to play a crucial role in managing and preventing NMS issues and PCP role.  
I would encourage you, Fyslee, to visit the CCA website or the new OCA one and you tell me that my sole purpose is to rid subluxations.  It is, at least in Canada, a dying faction as CMCC and UQTR embrance scientific chiropractic and not traditional/philosophical (straight) chiropractic.

www.chiropractic.on.ca

It is always important to have different perspectives on issues to remain objective.  I am not an evangelist (as a good analogy to the straights/subluxation based) and definitely have my criticisms with my profession, but it's mainly a generational thing.  The evidence-based Doctor of Chiropractic in 2008 is not tied down to the philosophy of subluxations (metaphysically) or at least in Canada (my POV which conflicts with your chiropractic POV which is US and not a world wide one.  

In fact, every DC since 2002 has been educated in the integrative EBM curriculum (CMCC is 45 minutes away from McMaster University, where evidence based medicine was born) Canada, unlike the US has NO subluxation based schools and they are both university degree granting institutions.  This is important because credits obtained at CMCC and UQTR can be TRANSFERRED to public universities unlike before.

In the end, Fyslee, you will begin to appreciate the sophistication of contemporary chiropractors.  Most of us have 4 year undergrad degrees in kinesiology of the life sciences and obtain various other treatment modalities (soft tissue such as ART/Graston/SASTM, get diplomas in Medical Acupuncture from McMaster University by the Department of Anaesthesia from MDs who designed the course from a anatomy/neurophysiological POV, obtained CSCS designations from the NSCA (http://www.nsca-cc.org/) etc.

8236,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book """"The Real Split In The International"""" could just as well be called the """"fundamental split"""" if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both. 
Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a """"revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation"""" thing going on). 
In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting. 
As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.

 Dear Shirahadasha, Please AT LEAST consider looking up terms in Wiki itself before you make statements. Canon from Greek kanon """"rule"""" (perhaps originally from kanna """"reed"""", cognate to cane) is used in various meanings. There is no Jewish entry here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon. There is however a """"Biblical canon"""" which includes a Jewish canon section. However there are rules on why some books are included in TaNaKh, and some are not. There is NO evidence in JEWISH sources that there EVER was a 'canon' in the Christian sense of the word. Most deduction is based on non-Jewish sources and modern academic research. Therefore you can not call TaNaKh a canon just so it can fall into the same definition as Christian works. This is particularly true since the TaNaKh is not consistently used by Christianity to 'rule' on issues of dogma, and the Christian canon is not used at all in Jewish halacha.""",0
791,"""::::::::Now, surely you aren't suggesting plagiarism? If one is to avoid plagiarism, one must rephrase the information in the source in their own words, and in doing so, must invariably inject their own POV into it.

To quote Jacob Bronowski: """"One aim of the physical sciences has been to give an exact picture of the material world. One achievement of physics in the twentieth century has been to prove that that aim is unattainable. The world is not a fixed, solid array of objects, out there, for it cannot be fully separated from out perception of it. There is no absolute knowledge. And those who claim it, whether they are scientists or dogmatists open the door to tragedy. All information is imperfect. We have to treat it with humility.

You are mistaken. The Johnson School is no different than the departments in the Arts College or the Engineering School. PhD students enroll in the Graduate School and pick a """"field,"""" which roughly correspond to the various academic departments (e.g., Chemistry, Management, Mechanical Engineering.)  The Johnson School is not acredited to grant PhD degrees.  I still think that the article is POV because its history and alumni list give short-shrift to the Public Administration and Health Care Administration aspect of the school. For most of the school existence, these were perhaps its most distinguished programs.  The idea of reassigning notable alumni from the school where they graduated to a different school based on subsequent reorganizations is troubling.  I think we should just have  the list of notable alumni in the main Cornell Univrersity article and the List of Cornell University people.  In some cases, there is no modern equivalent to the program which granted a particular degree and in other cases we may not know the school.  Does it matter that Ed Marinaro was a Hotel School graduate when he is notable as a football player and actor and never entered the hotel industry?  Does it matter that Keith Olbermann went to the Ag School and is therefore presumptively less credible than Ann Coulter?  Breaking down notable alumni based on the current administrative location of their degree program is POV and SYN.   """,0

The way it is written it makes it sound that Kosovo is a province of Yugoslavia. I am pretty sure this is not the case otherwise its position under international law would be similar to that of Montenegro and independence would be much less of a problem than it is at this point. The article should be unprotected and reference to Serbia should be included. I dont think Albanian wikipedians should try to stop this from happening. The problem (and paradox) of Kosovo still being part of Serbia is not going to go away by negating it on wikipedia.

Under normal circumstances I would accept the argument that is just an example of various Balkan states dreams of empire (it also shows Greece overlapping FYROM).

2. US/UN resolutions that make it very plain... Greeks don't maps showing their country controlled by FYROM remote funny. I really don't care what the reasons are for drawing them. (something that certain admins are having problems grasping)

3. The creator of the map (something I doubt even Balkanfever knows)... is from FYROM. (I researched it but didn't mention it to anyone yet)

I don't fricken want to see any more maps coming out of FYROM sources showing Greece occupied. (If some neutral third party unrelated to FYROM does it... that's another matter.)

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would

My Reverting of The Edit In The History Section
I didn't revert the edit because the material you removed isn't redundant in some ways, which is fairly obvious if you read the  section as a whole. The entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion, I'd suggest that its got non NPOV issues in several spots, the tone it's written in and choice of words seem somewhat """"chatty"""" and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain, what I'd argue, are historical inaccuracies in some places. Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.

Dear Woohookitty,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, where it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

 Some villages (vesnice) are parts of cities (Sedlec-Prčice is """"město"""" but contain two towns and 34 small villages as municipal parts), some villages are parts of big municipalities which contain several (up to tens) of villages, some villages constitute a small one-village municipality. Municipalities which are neither """"město"""" nor """"městys"""" are sometimes called """"vesnice"""" but that is incorrect and confusing. Municipalities which are neither """"město"""" nor """"městys"""" are called simply """"obec"""" (municipality). 

 Cities and towns are also municipalities but use the word """"město"""" or """"městys"""" instead of """"obec"""". (There exists also differentiation by administrative level - the first grade is simply obec, the second grade is """"pověřená obec"""" (""""obec s pověřeným obecním úřadem""""), the third grade is """"obec s rozšířenou působností"""". Most of the second-grade municipalites and nearly all third-grade municipalities are cities (but many of smaller cities are of the first grade). The biggest 26 cities (cca over 40.000 inhab.) are titled """"statutární město"""". 

 Besides that, some cities are seat of the district (""""okresní město"""", now only formal) or seat of the region (""""krajské město"""", in both systems of regions). Prague as """"hlavní město"""" (capital city) have a special status.   """,0

the population of these three regions doesnt reach one million, and Dutch is definetly not a national language in these places. Plus, the Netherlands and Belgium have a lot of immigrants. So I belive more in the 20 million figure, rather than the 23 million one.- 5 July 2005 11:27 (UTC)
There are for example probably about 12 million native speakers in the Netherlands, once you sutract immigrants, Frisian, Limburgish, and other Germanic language speakers. Suriname definitely isn't natively Dutch speaking; some of the languages there are closer to English (if you can even recognize gbe for 'leave' as derived from English!). So 20 million may be a rather generous number.  2005 July 5 17:50 (UTC)

 Naming convention violation part #3 

(Tiderolls) The guideline Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English), under the section heading Including alternatives, states that """"The body of each article, preferably in its first paragraph, should list all common names by which its subject is widely known."""" The first sentence of that guideline states """"The title of an article should generally use the version of the name of the subject which is most common in the English language, as you would find it in reliable sources""""...(My emphasis). 

(NCDane) I read the naming convention before my previous message to you, and I considered Naming convention citations I originally provded to to constitute superseding, prima facie authority. I think they are worth repeating, and I will repeat them:German proper names should be treated with care, and attention to English practice

The title of an article should generally use the version of the name of the subject which is most common in the English language''''(TR) That means an editor must support their position by providing sources that show a common English usage. 

(NCD) That is ridiculous because the article's previous authors did not provide citation, and the burden should be on them because they were the ones using a letter which does not exist in the English alphabet. 

Furthermore, you know as well as I do that ~B is not common English usage:  I am sure you, like me,  have NEVER in your life seen it used in ANY English-language publication EXCEPT for Wikipedia, and perhaps the Internet Wiki copycats. 

But since I am up against unreasonable legalism on this issue,  here is the first page of Google ENGLISH LANGUAGE BOOK hits on the name “Uli Hoeness”: 

http://books.google.com/books?id=rQfNyLM5svIC&pg;=PA200&dq;=uli+hoeness&hl;=en&ei;=17IPTYvdG8GB8gat5t3lDQ&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=uli%20hoeness&f;=false

As you can see “Hoeness” is the version used.I also googled the next five pages and can confirm no use of ~B by any other English book source.I also found that the name “Uli Hoeness” does not occur in encyclopedias Brittanica,
Columbia/Bartleby and How Stuff Works.' 

However, it does occur twice as “Hoeness” in infoplease:'''

http://www.infoplease.com/search?q=+hoeness&in;=all&fr;=iptn&x;=45&y;=9

And it occurs 10 times times as “Hoeness” on the 1st page of Encyclopdia.com:

http://www.encyclopedia.com/searchresults.aspx?q=uli+hoeness 

(TR) Did you read the discussion that resulted from your post here? Several editors explained how the rendering of an article's subject spelling is determined. 

(NCD) No I did not see it. Where is it?

(TR) Some of those editors even agreed, in that particular instance, that the present usage was incorrect. Those editors, however, cited sources to support their position rather than simply stating """"it's obviously incorrect"""". It appears that no consensus to change was reached as the article name remains unchanged. I have not seen one editor agree with you that there exists """"indiscriminate foreign language insinuations """". There may be individual instances that need to be addressed (with the proper sourcing and discussion), but, under the present guideline, I see no need for wholesale changes. There is no """"authority"""" on this project other than policy and consensus. If you wish a review of my position, you may contact any editor. Additionally, if you feel it necessary, you can raise the issue at the WP:Administrators' noticeboard/incidents. Tiderolls

Anyone have any thoughts on the addition of Bernard Lonergan to the list of notable metaphysicians?  Since Augustine, Aquinas are listed and Lonergan is clearly in this trajectory of Catholic philosophers, I thought he would be a good addition to the list. His work is well-regarded in 20th century philosophy, he certainly has the credentials, and I think many would agree he made highly significant contributions to metaphysics by extending the core ideas of Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas forward in the areas of cognitional theory, epistemology and verifiable metaphysics based on the """"data of consciousness"""" and his study of methodology in mathematics and empirical science. see Insight: A study of Human Understanding.

False, my site tenstringguitar.INFO is neither intended to promote a website nor is it a link to a blog. This site promotes scholarly information about the 10-string guitar as envisioned by Narciso Yepes. So 's claims against me/my site are simply dishonest. (Not unexpected.) Along the same vein, 's claim that Janet Marlow's site does not fail any criteria of """"links to be avoided"""" is also false. According to criterion no. 2 """"Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research"""" must be avoided on wikipedia. Yet  supports this site knowing fully that it is involved in the spread of misinformation.

Compare the claims made by Marlow  with the verifiable statements made by Yepes . 's claims that these are saying the same thing are clearly mistaken or dishonest. That is, Marlow claims """"there are four missing sympathetic resonances on the six string guitar ... C, Bb, Ab, and Gb"""" which have less sustain """"than the others"""". While Yepes states that """"On the six-string guitar only four notes of the scale have natural resonances or overtones, E, A, B, an D"""" and that the other EIGHT sympathetic resonances are missing. 

What  is doing here is not scholarship, it is not honest and it is discrediting wikipedia, but I need hardly say it because it is abundantly clear to readers. He gets away with it simply because he is an administrator.

I've added an animal deaths section. This article definitely reads like an advertisement (I also added that tag) and I believe this will help rectify that.

The park does have a less than positive history when it comes to animal cruelty even compared to other marine parks like Sea World. The Animal deaths section can be expanded as I believe there are more marine animal deaths (and perhaps land animal deaths) I haven't found. This section could perhaps be expanded into a 'Criticisms of Marineland' section or perhaps even its own article if there's enough material. I'd be willing to support that venture.

    obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"""", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being """"Handy with a cap"""" or even related to the disabled.

Quicksilver, you can speculate about indígena, but until you find some other notable source which puts forward this proposed derivation, it should not be included.

Surely native spanish speakers themselves would not get confused between """"indígena"""" and references to the East Indies (""""las Indias Orientales""""). Whether Columbus really believed what he wrote about reaching the Indies, we can only speculate- Eratosthenes's relatively accurate calculation of the Earth's circumference was only one estimate amongst many, was not generally held, and AFAIK we've nothing to indicate that Columbus accepted or relied on this figure. | TALK 02:49, 2005 September 5 (UTC)

Renn is an Anglo-Norman castle expert, and he suggests it was begun in the 1130s and finished in the 1140s.  That seems the most reasonable estimate.DeAragon """,0

The problem, precisely, is that if you assume that there is an underlying structure [noun] is raining [object], then from the very start you deny the possibility that the pronoun before the verb is in fact meaningless, i. e. a dummy word. If the pronoun refers to a noun and you can say what this noun is, then by definition it's not a dummy pronoun. My contention is that (maybe) the verb is really impersonal, i. e. its subject is truly a dummy word, not meant to mean anything but only appearing there to fill a syntactic slot.

The definition given at the start of the article is not sourced appropriately, I know; it just covers what I think are the features of what linguists call """"dummy pronoun"""", based on my amateur experience on the matter. I know it's not completely wrong or misleading, though it probably needs a different form. The glossary definition above, OTOH, is a bit too vague, but in any case, note that the very first example of dummy word given below in the source is the it in It is raining.""",0

Featuring Bode, who has for eleven years worked with the noise/ambient/electronics scene on his own and side projects, making live appearances at cultural institutions in Porto Alegre and releasing his work through netlabels and cd-r distros; Bruno, a drummer of various styles, but having jazz and free improv as his main focus; CP, a bass player that was part of what is believed to be the ever seen only Double Trio of Punk Rock and Diego, a Basement Solo clarinet player without audience, making freely improvised music, noise and structured improvisation.

The Name of the band is homonymous to the Antropology Essay by Bruno Latour – We’ve Never Been Modern -, published in 1991.

Time has passed and new instruments were added, like flutes, whistles, harmonicas, kazoos, toys, small percussion and aleatory objects, following the intuitive direction that each session offers.

As of Mats Gustafsson Show (FIRE), on 2011 may 15th, the band recorded 30 cd-r to be distributed among the free jazz/free improv aficionados.",0

How do you not understand that you're confirming that the Babylonian empire ended in 539 when its king was called to account?!!  
Strawman. Try again  talk 

Read Jeremiah 25:12. It gives an order of events. 1) 70 years ends. 2) Babylon's king is called to account. Babylon's king was called to account in 539. Ergo, 70 years ended in 539. Ergo, 70 years of nations serving Babylon began in 609. Babylon replaced the Assyrian world power in 609.  
As I keep telling you, your exegesis is fatuous for it obviates the context of 2 Chronicles 36:20,21; Jeremiah 25:12; Zechariah 1:12; Daniel 9:2; Zechariah 7:5 and Jeremiah 29:10, among others. Try again.  talk 

 Fringe Views? 

Please desist from changing articles to match the fringe views of Jehovah's Witnesses. You might like to start a section at articles' Talk pages, however it is unlikely that you will be able to indicate any widespread support for the alternative views taught by your religion. Thanks.  

How is it fringe when they're based on accurate and reliable sources? Wikipedia is a place for truth not your noetical bigotry.   
Reliable sources indicate the widely accepted chronology of the period. They do not support the JW chronology. And you didn't even provide any sources. You will need to discuss at the article's Talk pages to reach a concensus, however there are no mainstream sources in support of your views.  

Agreed. I've reverted you again.   
You are both misinformed. According to the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus conquered Babylon in October 539 B.C.E. Cyrus’ first regal year began in the spring of 538 B.C.E. This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E. or “the seventh month (Tishri)” as Ezra 3:1 says.

It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalem’s destruction. Dates other than 607 BCE ignore the statements in Scripture that the land would be desolate for 70 years. (Daniel 9:1,2)    

Looking at your other edits I'm concerned that you don't have any grasp yet of WP:NPOV. I've raised them at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bible#Editor changes biblical dates, etc where I hope you will explain your edits. You are also failing to use WP:Edit summaries, which is sufficient reason for many people to revert you.   

Thank you for the reminder concerning the """"edit summaries"""" field.   

You said: This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E.. That is wrong. The JW conclusion that the Jews 'must' have returned the following year is entirely speculative. Josephus explicitly states that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus second year, which means the Jews were back in his first year, which means Cyrus decree was made at the beginning of hist first year, and the Jews then had 6 months to make the 4-month journey back to Jerusalem.

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were mainly consumed by their local rivals.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas in the page of the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them?

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned.

312,"""Ekantik, do you believe that Sathya Sai Baba can miraculously transform his genitals? I would appreciate an answer.

I also find it amusing that Ekantik, of all people, is attempting to point out strange beliefs held by Sai Devotees when Ekantik is a Hare Krishna Congregational Member and a Gaudiya Vaishnava who has openly defended his belief that Lord Krishna literally manifested 16,000 seperate human forms, married 16,000 seperate women, copulated with each one of them and generated innumerable offspring. Sanjay also believes that Lord Krishna held an entire mountain aloft on his pinky finger for 7 days and nights and defends scriptures that say the Lord Vishnu (a male) transformed himself into a woman (Mohini Devi). So it appears that Ekantik and Sai Devotees are not really that different as far as strange beliefs and miracle stories are concerned. I can't help to wonder why Ekantik mocks strange beliefs when he holds them himself.

Funny how Ekantik and Andries (critics of Sathya Sai Baba) want to promote """"well sourced"""" stories about gential switch tales and think the aura reference (written by a doctor in a well known Sri Lankan newspaper) is not """"well sourced"""". This whole thing is POV and the attempt to skew the article with a POV is evidenced by these discussions. Good luck Wikisunn. You see what you are up against?  talk-email

3555,"""== Audio File ==

DCGeist is vandalising this article by repeatedly removing content while refusing to exaplin the problem or start a discussion to correct the problem.  The problem, he says, is """"style"""", which he believes """"very clearly explains the problem"""".  He prefers to delete content rather than help to edit the page to allow its inclusion.  Is United States to be the only country in the Western Hemisphere without an audio file for pronunciation of the name? 

When did """"style"""" become so important that it justifies the deletion of content over style correction?   

The addition is ungrammatical.
It clutters the article's opening sentence. It is visually off-putting and difficult to read. This is a very significant stylistic concern; by contrast, the addition of an audio clip pronouncing two common English words is a minor and unnecessary matter of content.—  

 Could you explain why you think the addition is ungrammatical in the parenthetical comment?  Do you have a proposed solution that will avoid deleting content, or is deleting content your purpose?  The opening can be reworded, rather than deleting content.  Please note that the pronunciation, even of """"common"""" words in English is of value to both non-native speakers as well as native-born speakers, since even common words may change pronunciation within a proper name.  Please justify having only one country in North America whose article is forbidden to contain an audio file.   

While remaining mostly neutral on this front, please don't call something """"vandalism"""" when it's not. This is a disagreement, and under the terms of """"Bold, Revert, Discuss"""", the onus is actually now upon you to justify its inclusion, not the other way around. But either way, it's not obvious vandalism. It annoys admins when people throw that term around. Or at least me. And as for """"Is United States to be the only country in the western hemisphere"""", I point out that """"United States"""" is the only country name in the Western hemisphere made up entirely of common words, without proper names. (""""of America"""" is different, of course, but the audio file isn't about that name) So there is an argument to say that it is the country least in need of a pronunciation guide, since there's no unusual or proper words in that particular name.   

But """"united"""" contains vowels which do not behave in the way that non-native speakers expect.  I have taught English overseas, and have seen the problems firsthand.  The word """"united"""" has no encyclopedia article here, nor pronunciation given, for a non-native speaker to examine.  Also, the word """"states"""" is a plural, and English plurals have two possible pronunciations for the added final """"-s"""": /s/ or /z/, according to rules that native speakers learn but which non-native speakers struggle with.  For these reasons alone, non-native speakers """,0

Northern Ireland (, Ulster Scots: Norlin Airlann) is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland[2]...

2 In common with the other constituent parts of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is sometimes referred to as a """"country"""" (example). The UK government also refers specifically to Northern Ireland as being a """"province"""" (UK: example; NI: example) or a """"region"""" (UK: example; NI: example). Regardless of the choice of term, it is likely to be unsatisfactory and can imply a preferred political perspective:
 """"One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government."""" - J. Whyte and G. FitzGerald, 1991, Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press: Oxford
 """"One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change."""" - S. Dunn and H. Dawson, 2000, An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Edwin Mellen Press: Lampeter
 """"Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'."""" - D. Murphy, 1979, A Place Apart, Penguin Books: London and it is situated in the north-east of the island of Ireland. It shares a border with the Republic of Ireland to the south and west.

 A lot of points to respond to.
Aleenf1 - you once again ignored the fact (or are being misleading intentionally) about national titles.  On Wikipedia pages, we use China, Laos, Palestine, Iran, etc. when those are NOT the official IOC designations.  Not only are those now the official names, those are not even the official IOC designations.  Yet, we still use them without question.  It is only with the situation of Taiwan that you make an issue of it.  I am not even proposing the sole use of Taiwan, just it's mention as a parenthetical.  Otherwise, I insist that you use People's Republic of China, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Islamic Republic of Iran, Palestinian Authority, ETC. as those are the IOC designations for those countries.  THAT is where your hypocrisy lies.
Rebskii - People SEE Chinese Taipei, but they don't know it is Taiwan.  Why do you think one of Taiwan's gold medal winners had to declare before the international press in Athens, in English, """"I am from Taiwan.""""?  It is because there is much confusion among people.  I spoke with a couple of Australian baseball fans who made the trip from Australia to see the 2006 Intercontinental Cup here in Taichung.  They didn't know that Chinese Taipei was in fact Taiwan until they started making plans for the trip.  It is not even universally known among sports fans, much less the general public.
As for the domains of Taiwan, Orchid Island and Green Island, among others, are historically linked with Taiwan and have long been administratively a part of Taiwan.  The only counties that are not historically part of Taiwan are the tiny islands with some 10,000 people off the coast of Fujian which produces none of our athletes.  Taiwan is the commonly used phrase on the street domestically, not ROC and not Chinese Taipei.
We are not bound by the opinions and illegal claims of barbarous dictators in Beijing.  
If you look at the good article guidelines, one of them is that the article should provide appropriate information for people who are not necessarily familiar with the subject.  Simply stating Chinese Taipei does not meet that standard because few people know what it is.  A simple parenthetical (Taiwan) beside Chinese Taipei accomplishes one of the standards of good article writing with very little trouble.
Again, if you insist on ONLY Chinese Taipei because that is the IOC designation, then use all of the other IOC designations for the other countries I have listed above.

I was told in no uncertain terms that I could NOT refer to anyone, living or dead, by their 1st names on WP, & if a female had a title, she had to be referred to as that throughout her article - ie, *Lady Amy* or *Lady Dudley* for Amy Robsart, even though *Lady Amy* was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight & had no title, & wrong after Northumberland was attainted & all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl & a duke, & she did not become *Lady Dudley* until Elizabeth I knighted Robert Dudley near the end of Amy's life nor was she then *Lady Amy Dudley* as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl & duke.  I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles, but was told it was against WP *rules* (though I wasn't pointed to a link for it).  Noblewomen are usually called by their 1st names round here as far as I can see, even when they have surnames & are not *of* something!  Mary Boleyn is called *Mary*, not *Lady Carey* or *Lady Stafford*, Catherine Neville is called *Catherine* & not *the Duchess of Norfolk*, etc, & they're not royals.  

As for males, I was told they had to be referred to by their title - ie, *Leicester* -  or last name - ie, *Dudley*.  I was banging head on keyboard going, but - no one just says *the king* all the time or refers to them as *Plantagenet* or keeps changing their titles - ie, Henry of Bolingbroke going from Earl of Derby to Duke of Hereford to Duke of Lancaster to King of England -

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1

Leaving out Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa for a moment, do you mean that you doubt he received recognitions such as this? You seem to be making the point that because you cannot find these recognitions in the press that they are somehow forgeries or myths? Hey, they ain't the Nobel Peace Prize but they are not fake. You seem to be mixing up three issues; 1) whether Hubbard led an extraordinary life and 2) whether he received extraordinary recognition as a humanitarian and 3) how Scientologists generally regard Hubbard. Those issues are not related. I think that even critics will agree that Hubbard led an extraordinary life. And neither 1) nor 2) are really related to his """"personality"""" either. I mean, was/is Mandela a bad husband? Did/does he have a temper? Who knows, you certainly won't find out in our article on him. But if someone decided to write a smear piece on him I am sure that they can find as many people that will say something bad about his """"personality"""" as we see in our Hubbard pieces. Re 3) This is not about my having some """"faith"""" or other, this is about how I have view Hubbard after intimate experience with his creations, Dianetics and Scientology and reading, IDK, millions of his words, and listening to hundreds of hours of lectures. I think that entitles me to have an opinion without getting all mystical and talking """"faith"""". I am sorry that you are getting frustrated but the simple point is that so long as the """"truth"""" about Hubbard as I see it (which, incidentally, factors in the criticisms) does not seem to be in the press then I will feel that what is there is undoubtedly one-sided. You want me to somehow persuade how that what I have come to feel based on a LOT of experience (and extensive research into the criticisms) is """"truer"""" than what some journalist wrote after talking to some few critics?

I'm happy to believe that the name """"Blackbeard"""" is used to describe a character in an upcoming movie. The issue for this article is why that is sufficiently significant to the modern cultural understanding of Blackbeard, for it to warrant inclusion in the article on the historical figure. Simply stating that Blackbeard is mentioned in a modern-day film/book/comic/play doesn't tell us anything about how the historical figure is interpreted, and risks being indiscriminate information which does little to advance our understanding of the topic. I suspect before we include the fact that Blackbeard wll be mentioned in yet another modern movie, we would need to know how this mention is of enduring cultural significance. I also doubt that the real-life Blackbeard can be presented in a historically accurate context in the otherwise fictional universe of POTC> More likely, and with all respect to Ian McShane, it is likely Blackbeard will simply be a large black-bearded pirate who has matches in his beard and says """"Yarr."""" An entertaining figure no doubt, but not one that advances this article, which is about the real-life Caribbean pirate.

I don't mean this to sound snarky, so my apologies if it comes across that way. It's just that articles like this can quickly amass extensive and fairly trivial lists of mentions, including every time the subject is even referred to in sitcoms and the like. Check out the page history from about a year ago, to see what I mean. I'd prefer not to return to simple lists of mentions, even when Blackbeard is a major character in the film/novel/comic/TV episode. Instead and for what its worth, I support Parrot's suggestion of mentioning it at the film's article, where it has apropriate context.

""""Philip knew the dangers that de Molay represented; his own sons were nearly sexually molested by de Molay. Upon escaping the vile pervert, they confessed to Philip what de Molay had tried to do.""""

""""It is said that Jacques de Molay cursed Philippe le Bel and his descent from his execution pyre, a curse which was responded to by Philip shouting in defiance """"Fuck de Molay!""""""""

""""It has been speculated that several of the boys whom de Molay had corrupted had grown to enjoy the perversions of the homosexual lifestyle introduced to them""""

5583,"Erik, for crying out loud. You legally can have sex with children, but not with underage children. Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18. In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. Do you know the first thing about the topic? 

The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church. 

Public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children, so stop adding in an irrelevant topic.

""""Raistlin Majere is also known as Fistandantilus, the archmage who originally tried to become a god himself."""" Someone needs to justify this statement. Unless I remember incorrectly, and this is almost 20 years ago that I read the core books, Raistlin merely owned Fistandatilus's staff. They are not the same character    

In """"The Soulforge"""" by Margaret Weis (and this is an uber quick summary) it is revealed that Raistlin (R) had made a deal with Fistandantilus (F) to complete the Test, reneged on it, but then F was able to put his """"soul"""" (for lack of a better term at the moment) inside R's body. In the """"Dragonlance Legends"""" series (Weis and Hickman) R goes back in time to learn the rest of F's secrets, and they have a magic battle. While the victor is considered to be R, and goes by R, he actually possesses the memories/abilities of both, and they both had the desire to become a god by destroying Takhisis,  so it is unclear which one actually survived the battle. So, with the lack of clear evidence, it is a Schrodinger's Cat situation. By which I mean that, from that point in the storyline, R can be seen as both R AND F, even though they started out as two different people. (Oh, and quick side note, Raistlin's staff was not F's, it was the Staff of Magius)

Fair use rationale for Image:TranquilityPark.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:TranquilityPark.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.   """,0

 Tags 

Back on February 23, you made some hefty edits to the Santa Claus in Northern American culture article.  In captioning some images, you used a few pairs of  tags (which in itself didn't affect the size of the text within the captions), but you didn't properly close the tags, so all the text afterwards was made to be really tiny.  When you use a tag, you have to close it by typing a slash into the tag, like this:   I don't know why nobody noticed that the article was messed up until at least three months later, but I've taken care of it.

Also, while I'm at it, when I saw who had made the edit, I was slightly concerned to see the """"bot"""" part of your username—it made me worry that someone had programmed a bot to make edits, but that the person hadn't programmed the bot to correctly close tags.

Mr. Davis,

Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be """"complete"""".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.

You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.

On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, """"They did all that for me!""""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   """,0

Also it would have to be paired with fact that the specimen (almost exclusively associated with Y-DNA R1a1) from South Siberia and Kazakhstan (*) had almost exclusively mtDNA haplogroups of west eurasian/european origin especially during bronze age (as far as 1,800 BC). If we link that with the europoid phenotypes with light-colored eyes and hair and pale skin of andronovo south siberians described in the recent article of human genetics 
( http://www.springerlink.com/content/4462755368m322k8/ ), that's meaningful and favors an European origin of these R1a1. 
Especially since no south Asian haplogroups are linked to the spread of R1a1, up to Europe. 
.
Pretty meaningful, especially since such phenotypes are found where high frequency of R1a1 are found in Asia (like 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, east Afghanistan and north Pakistan) -> examples of such clearly europoid phenotypes in these regions of Asia that matches the description of south Siberian of Bronze age (andronovo culture horizon),

Luckily these morons only know about two celebs I work for, and NONE of my clients could care less about wiki.  What we all care about is the link to the official site so the option for true and relevant information is available to them.  We don't have time to play the wiki-troll game.   So, YES, you can see the history of this omnitroll, and that username was created JUST for editing those two pages.  I expect the user terminated, and the connecting profiles to be found and terminated.  You can see the moronic trail they left in the history, regardless of username.  It's all the same trolls.

Again, we could care less about anything this site offers, but if information of my clients is going to be posted, the link to the official pages MUST be included.

 Okay, then let's turn it around: I don't know what your professional background is, but let's say you are contributing to an article fully in line with your profession, and you'll literally see dozens of users engaging in edit wars reverting not only your own edits, but also well-informed edits made by others - all this going on for a couple of days. That's exactly when you guys (i.e. ADMINS) you should have a careful look: I'm not the problem, at most I am a symptom of it, because I was trying to be part of the solution by pointing out the aforementioned issues. The quality fluctations of that particular article have been severe, it seems that there's a huge mess of people editing without any relevant background knowledge whatsoever. This has nothing to do with elitism: wikipedia (or any encyclopedia) cannot just thrive through people without any domain expertise. And other users have been highlighting these issues, too - but were ignored because their criticism also affected wp admins. Really, you cannot expect high quality articles if the people """"writing"""" it are merely acting like robots adding refs to articles that they don't understand, let alone briefings that they never watched in the first place. Regarding the term jackass, just look at the Jackass article, it describes fairly well what's going on there, just because there's huge public interest in the event, which attracts countless people who don't even bother getting informed in the first place, and rather prefer edit warring instead. BTW: I am not trying to talk common-sense to you, like I said: I don't care about this account and/or IP being blocked or not - not even if it should not be temporary. The real issue here is lack of quality, and lack of wp admins enforcing rules to ensure a higher degree of quality. And this problem will persist regardless of this particular account/IP/person being blocked, inactive or deleted. This seems to be a severe case of Dunning-Kruger's. All the best, and thanks for taking the (trying to) time to explain yourself   """,0

The University seal was removed from this page.  Per the University's official logo guidelines, available at http://logo.wustl.edu, the seal is limited to items for Commencement and those events sponsored by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the deans and requires special permission from the University for use.

Please be advised that the University has in the past pursued legal action when images and symbols are used without permission for which permission is specifically required.
This unsigned comment was added by  (talk • contribs) .

First, I must kindly ask the user who posted this topic to please sign their username to their post in future. Secondly, the use of Washington University’s seal in a Wikipedia article is perfectly fair and legal. Just as wikipedia is allowed to use the logo’s of McDonalds , Apple, and other US corporations that have also copyrighted their logo’s, a wikipedia article is still allowed to use College and University seals under the US copyright law’s fair use'' policy. Wikipedia does not need permission to use Washington University’s seal so long as it meets the fair use qualifications. Every other university's seal including  Harvard's, Northwestern's,  and Yale's is used in Wikipedia articles that reference them, even though they have similar policies about university seal use. This because wikipedia is a non-profit foundation, allowed to use copyrighted logo’s under the fair use policy.  

I will be reinstating Washington University's Seal to meet the format consistent with other US College and university articles. 

Please be advised that legal counsel has been notified.  The University makes available the official University logo for these purposes.  Use of the University seal is strictly prohibited and protected.  

The use of the Washington University seal even if it is copyrighted is allowed on Wikipedia through the fair use policy. Notify legal consul if you must but the Fair use policy has already been affirmed in court see: Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation. I have also examined user 's discussion page and found that the user has flouted Wikipedia rules and regulations in the past. Taking this into account I will continue to reinstate the university seal until the user   presents a concrete reason why I should not. Placing the university seal on the wikipedia article that it concerns is consistent with wikipedia format, and encouraged by the wikipedia community. The same policy which governs the use of Washington University logo also governs the Washington University seal. And I question  to be a spokesperson for the university and decide that it is acceptable to use the logo. Although I was unable to access the link that
  provided in an attempt to present their case my understanding is that the policy applies to the use of the seal by members of the university community and not an outside non for profit foundation. Once again there has been no violation of the fair use policy concerning the Washington University seal brought to my attention and 
87
Atherefore I continue reverting to the original article until one such violation is identified. 

user  please post Washington University seal policy in full on the talk page so users can examine it and compare it to other university policies as I said before I was unable to access the link, you still not be removing the seal PLEASE stop. 

I do agree with  that Fair Use doctrine permits use of the seal in such a not-for-profit context. (As a sidenote, Wikipedia's image tag for """"logos,"""" which asserts the right to use such images in this context, surely wasn't invented out of thin air; there's presumably some legal research/knowledge behind that tag's invention.) I think we might do well soliciting the advice of an administrator who has specific experience in copyright/Fair-Use issues, if this dispute continues. Surely this sort of issue must pop up on Wikipedia all the time.  

The official seal of the University is a protected trademark and may not be used without the written permission of the University.  The University has not",0

Agree. Of course it isn't real. But what really provided the sour taste was the trailer for Season One. An off-camera voice (presumably Esther) proclaims there really *is* an Amish Mafia. Amazing how that matches the series title perfectly! This is what I would expect from a seventh grader with a 'D' average struggling with an English essay or composition, not a truly authentic and spontaneous documentary. The executive producer of the show and the owner of Hot Snakes Media, Eric Evangelista on his LinkedIn page has for his goal as revolutionizing the way unscripted television is produced. Well one way you can to that is to just make it scripted which is what this garbage is. I am surprised Discovery purchased this series for a second season. Apparently their lineup is a little thin.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """,0

I don't agree that Mexico is a Regional Power at least of Latin America, it could be a Regional Power of Central America, but nowadays it is considered to be part of North America.
In the other areas of the world, the article is divided between East, West, North, South not between ethnic or languagegroups. If this was the case in Europe it could be considered, Latin, Germanic, Slave and even Anglo-Saxon groups.
If we consider this, in the Americas case it should be South America and not Latin America.
Second case, Mexico has a great GDP but in overal terms GDP is not the only factor, we should consider military, power projection and foreign policy. Mexico has a ridiculous military and projection power and politically is a subalternous nation to the USA 
Argentina, Venezuela or Colombia have greater military and power projection capabilities, historically they have been much more interventionous and agressive toward other nations than Mexico and today we can see the same, specially in Venezuela case.

Personally I agree with you, but you need sources to say it. This encyclopedia is not a place for Orignal Research. Furthemore, editors have produced sources saying Mexico is a Regional Power of Latin America, if we change it to South America there would be no place in wich to put Mexico. Besides, Brazil's influence is not restricted to South America, it would not make sense to say it is restricted since the sources don't agree.",0

I agree all your points are valid ones, and probably addressing all of them is an impossibility, but all of that might be considered overly critical. An article like this, I think the only way it could meet the standards you've just set forth (which, theoretically, are all standards wikipedia is supposed to set forth) would be to completely neuter the article the way the List of Internet phenomena was recently. 
The MAIN problem is the one you raised about subjectivity. I don't believe there's any single standard that could truly be used to qualify what is an """"unusual death"""", certainly not across the board for all types of death, and certainly not one which would be sourcable. I think, even above Original Research, it can be understood that the circumstances surrounding the demise of someone like, say, Michael Malloy, it can be understood that the vast majority of people would have no problem qualifying it as """"unusual"""". But, reasonable expectation for popular agreement is not a consistent standard. So I simply do not know how to solve this particular problem.
If I were being completely objective, I would say all of your points raised are totally valid, and satisfactorily answering all of them is an impossibility, which would mean the article should be considered for deletion. But, subjectively, I like the article and feel it does serve a purpose, and if there is a way of answering any of your points, I'd like to try. """,0

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public

That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not 
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.  And if I am wrong, then someone that is more

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in 
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT 
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and 
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any

Hi 

i) Let me express my strong reservations with promoting Kinfra through wikipedia, because it is a business entity.  Also, website of an organization is transient in nature. It can be updated and may change tomorrow.  So, as far as possible, we should use only published reports that cannot change with time.

ii) Still, what user  suggests could be accepted as a consensus, for now.

iii) This link to Public Relations Department does not have any word about Thiruvananthapuram being a hub now.  It speaks about cinema related activity in Thiruvananthapuram in 1970s/1980s. This cannot be used to claim Thiruvananthapuram's relevance today. But it could be a citation for the statement on Thiruvanthapuram being a base of Malayalam cinema in the past.

iv) Corporation of Thiruvanthapuram is a regional body and is not an unbiased source. This website of Corporation of Cochin (Kochi) also has such claims about cinema.   Claims of these bodies about pan-Kerala matters, like Cinema industry, cannot be used a a reliable source. These are outside the limits of their powers.

It has a big natural resource in fish due to be a continental shelf larger than Greenland size. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for
eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish
(Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass
was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains
incomplete.http://www.ccamlr.org/ccamlr_science/Vol-16-2009/01Duhamel-Hautecoeur.pdf

The continental shelf teem with life, because of the sunlight available in shallow waters, in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans' abyssal plain. The pelagic (water column) environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone, and the benthic (sea floor) province of the shelf is the sublittoral zone.Pinet 316-17, 418-19.
Most commercial exploitation from the sea, such as metallic-ore, non-metallic ore, and hydrocarbon extraction, takes place on the continental shelf. Sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the Convention on the Continental Shelf drawn up by the UN's International Law Commission in 1958. This was partly superseded by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance.

France extend its jurisdiction over 567 732 square kilometers of the neighboring continental shelf from the land area of 7 215 resulting in 574 947 square kilometers. There are besides some fishing boats and vessels, owned by fishermen on Réunion Island, a department of France approximately 3,300 km (2,100 miles) to the north, who are licensed to fish within the archipelago's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Govern of France principal activities on the Kerguelen Islands focus mostly on scientific research, earth sciences and biology. 
The so-called Kerguelen microcontinent or Kerguelen Plateau include charcoal and conglomerate fragments of gneiss indicate that much of the plateau was above sea level an covered by dense conifer forest.  Tt sanks 20 million years ago and is now  below sea level. It has sedimentary rocks similar to the ones found in Australia and India, suggesting it was gondwanan origen.

The former sounding rocket range to the east of Port-aux-Français  is currently the site of a SuperDARN radar.

Since 1992, the French Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) has operated a satellite and rocket tracking station which is located four kilometers east of Port-aux-Français. There was a need for a tracking station in the Southern Hemisphere, and the French government required that it be located on French territory, rather than in a populated, foreign place like Australia or New Zealand.""""

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article. 

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). Kershaw, Joachimsthaler, Thomas, Trevor-Roper, Beevor, Shirer, Ryan, Toland, Eberle/Uhl, Lehmann/Carroll, O’Donnell, Victor, Petrova/Watson. (Vinogradov hit a snag, reordered). These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010. I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources, but I think that should be addressed. If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved. But I can not help but believe that this article has problems with it’s process.Wm5200 (talk)'""""

After reviewing your link, it appears my only contribution to this issue was a poorly thought-out side remark to an editor in an unrelated ANI a few months back.

I can only give you my personal assurance that I did not leave Wikipedia for two months as part of a scheme to evade your investigation. I know you've said you're incredulous to that notion, but I will offer you this personal assurance anyway. 
 Kindly accept this post in the spirit in which it was intended - as a frank and direct response to concerns you are expressing - and not as a slight in any way. If I have failed to communicate something here with appropriate finesse, understand it is only because of serious IRL issues I currently face that limit the time I can commit to pursuing online intrigue, and absolutely not because I am trying to scandalize you. 
If there is anything else I can help you with, please do not hesitate to let me know, however, in interests of wrapping this up in a succinct manner, I would like to suggest we terminate this back-and-forth and allow ArbCom to do whatever it is their role in this is supposed to be. Best -

The South African intellectual and scholar Xolela Mangcu has entered the global discussion, building on a highly visible lecture he gave in Cape Town for the Wolpe Trust last June 18, """"Jacob Zuma on the Politics of Grievance"""" (http://www.wolpetrust.org.za/dialogue2007/mangcupaper.pdf ). In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of """"populism"""" that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites. He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7, 2007, drawing on Gianna Pomata's scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of """"Enlightenment rationalism"""" and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures. He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways. . Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book, To the Brink (Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal, 2008), sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic.php?id=2079

As far as Mike Huckabee's """"populism"""" is concerned, the piece by David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times January 13, 2008 (""""Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee"""") has a detailed discussion of why many Catholics and evangelicals see him as populist. The article, among many in the American election season, is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the US and Europe. In the US the term, on balance, clearly has positive associations  otherwise major candidates like Edwards and Huckabee would not use it in self-description. This is  a product, most likely, of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers' cooperatives, New Deal reform, and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist.

Their site claims to produce stamps using themes that are licensed by various folks that can be used as postage (the site also claims the USPS has authorized this). In Selena's case it appears her estate licensed her image to this company and they produced stamps. While these stamps may be valid for US postage, I feel she doesn't qualify for this list due to the stamps being issued by a private firm and not by the USPS.

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1

 HST > Notable? 

832, In the heading it says: """"Notable roles"""". The three previous mentions were roles that the play and/or film, Truman was the main subject, taking up the bulk of screen/stage time and lines. These also won critical acclaim. The combination of the amount of script and praise is what made these portrayals of Truman notable. Does your addition really fit: """"Notable""""? There have been lots of roles with Truman in them:

Flags of Our Fathers (2006) Played by David Patrick Kelly (as President Truman)
Hiroshima (2005) (TV) Played by Kenneth Jay (as Truman)
The Messenger: Based on a True Story (2005) Played by Raymond Starzmann (as President Truman)
Keep the Faith, Baby (2002) (TV) Played by Cedric Smith (as U.S. President Truman)
""""Futurama"""" - Roswell That Ends Well (2001) TV episode, Played by Maurice LaMarche (as President Harry Truman)
""""The Korean War"""" (2001) TV series Played by Harris Shore (as President Harry Truman)
""""The Simpsons"""" - The Trouble with Trillions (1998) TV episode, Played by Dan Castellaneta (as President Truman)
""""Dark Skies"""" - Moving Targets (1996) TV episode, Played by Hansford Rowe (as President Harry Truman)
Truman (1995) (TV) Played by Gary Sinise
Hiroshima (1995) (TV) Played by Kenneth Welsh (as President Harry S Truman)
Brenda Starr (1989) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S. Truman)
Day One (1989) (TV) Played by Richard Dysart (as President Harry S. Truman)
""""War and Remembrance"""" (1988) TV series Played by Richard Dysart (as President Harry S Truman)
J. Edgar Hoover (1987) (TV) Played by Walker Edmiston
Eleanor, First Lady of the World (1982) (TV) Played by Richard McKenzie
Inchon (1981) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)
Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb (1980) (TV) Played by Ed Nelson (as President Harry S Truman)
""""Backstairs at the White House"""" (1979) TV series Played by Harry Morgan (as President Harry S. Truman)
MacArthur (1977) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S. Truman)... aka MacArthur, the Rebel General (UK) 
Tail Gunner Joe (1977) (TV) Played by Robert Symonds (as President Harry S. Truman)
Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders
Truman at Potsdam (1976) (TV) Played by Ed Flanders (as President Harry S Truman)
Collision Course: Truman vs. MacArthur (1976) (TV) Played by E.G. Marshall (as President Harry S Truman)... aka Collision Course (USA: short title) 
Give 'em Hell, Harry! (1975) Played by James Whitmore (as Harry S Truman)
The Man from Independence (1974) Played by Robert Vaughn (as Harry S Truman)
The Beginning or the End (1947) Played by Art Baker (as President Harry S. Truman)

But, Give 'em Hell, Harry! and Truman, both on stage and screen where entirely about Truman. In Give 'em Hell (if you have seen it), there is nobody else. It is a one-man play, 100% of the lines are portraying Truman. And Flanders played Truman at least four times, including the bulk of the work being about him in at least two occasions; Harry S. Truman: Plain Speaking and Truman at Potsdam. So, is his charactership in Flags of Our Fathers really """"notable""""?

Very tiny point; in the """"Early roles"""" section:

They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination.[37] Camp dogs would also have benefitted from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes

It would be as well to spell the word the same way on each occasion.

Discussing The Existence of “repulsion particle” And Its Significance              
Zhuang Yiliong
Shanghai Institute of Science and Technology Management

Abstract:This report has advanced a assume about the existence of  “repellention” by a kind of new idea. Beginning with this, I have explained more successfully some import theory questions in the area of the present physics, cosmology and philosophy ect. At same time a few of new reasons have been raised But this is only rough idea of physical philosophy. many key details need to be answered by the improving science in the future.
Key words: repulsion particle, the velocity of light, red shift, cosmos background.
  
　　　While the researched object of physics are increasingly getting its limit observed through the instrument, the function in the research of academic ideas are more important. In this article, only assumes the existence of a new particle, so it seems possible for many difficulty of physics and cosmology to be resulted. Maybe the key to unlock the door of advancing access of physics lies not in the building of physics, but in the palace of philosophy.

One、Grounds of advancing the existence of  “repulsion particle” 

Philosophic puzzles: gravity and repulsion, this is a pair of antiquated contradiction, theory of physics is a philosophic  lame. Angels said that the true theory  of matter should give the equal status to gravity and repulsion, the theory of matter only based on gravity is wrong, insufficiency and unilateral. Newton needed to find the first driving force for his physics, or else the world can’t act .
There is contradiction between Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Einstein’s mass-velocity expression. In the law universal gravitation, the magnitude of gravitation is direct proportional to mass of the matter, the bigger the mass is, the stronger the gravity is; while in the mass-velocity expression, with the speed of the matter increasing, the mass will add. If the “mass” of the two law is the same, then the speed of matter will increase, and the gravity will be stronger, the matter will be drawn too tighten to move by the gravity. But in fact, it’s just opposition, the shotted cannonball is incline to break loose the gravitation, provided that the speed is high enough, it is able to fly off the orbit of the earth, even the solar system. This shows that the mass of adding with the speed increasing is different with that works on the gravitation, because it manifest obviously a kind of repulsion confronting the gravitation.  So that, the two characteristics (speed increases, gravitation reduces; speed reduces, gravitation increases.) out while the state of moving matter changes .it is right to reflect the invert process between gravity and repulsion inside the moving matter , and indicate the existence of difference idiocratic mass.
Newton believed: falling of an apple is because of the function of gravitation, then, we can question in the opposition, how can the apple get to the top of the tree? If we block out all of the complicated growing process of all tree with black-box theory, and only consider the beginning and the ending state, then, in the opinion of physics, there must be a kind of universal repulsion fighting back the gravitation working on the apple and pushing it to the high place. Therefor, the universal repulsion should exist everywhere, as well as the universal gravitation.
What is the essence of “force”? This question has been disputing for hundreds of years, and it’s still not clear today. Newton said that it is the measurement of the acceleration of moving matter. But this only describes the force, not explains the essential mechanism. So, in Newton mechanics, the mass of  the moving matter is unchangeable. Einstein brought out the character that the mass of matter is changed with the speed. He thought the activity of matter is result from getting energy, while energy can agglomerate matter, and this character of this matter is the same as the original matter, so can be added, resulting that the mass of matter may trend to infinite with the speed increasing. If we can import a kind of repulsion to explain it, and give the energy a carrier of practicality, then, the relation of movement and the “force” will be more clear.
The radiant energy is always multiple of some elementary unit, what on earth is the physical meaning of Plank quantum constants? If it can be seen as a material particle, and indicate the existence of repulsion particle? Ray radiation has the two character of wave and particle itself. As to E=h*v, Plank regarded the radiant energy as constant h multiply frequency v from the site of wave theory; if, from the point of particle theory,  we can regard it as the h combination of v quantu",0

If you think that Vaishnavas are born and die - than you are not to be delivered for millions of kalpas:

I am sorry, but this is fact:
""""Anyone who does not float in this inundation is most condemned. Such a person cannot be delivered for millions of kalpas.
PURPORT
The kalpa is explained in the Bhagavad-gītā (8.17): sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ. One day of Brahmā is called a kalpa. A yuga, or mahā-yuga, consists of 4,320,000 years, and one thousand such mahā-yugas constitute one kalpa. The author of Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta says that if one does not take advantage of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he cannot be delivered for millions of such kalpas.""""

However, you are lucky:
Q.    Can Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata be distributed to the common people before they have read the Gita and Bhagavatam?

 

A.    Yes, Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata can be distributed along with the Gita even before Bhagavatam according to Shrila Prabhupada’s purport on Cc Adi 8.36. In the first part of the purport he explains that Shrimad-Bhagavatam is difficult to understand for the common man due to four reasons:

 

(1)  It is very elaborate due to it being the commentary on the the highly condensed Vedanta-sutra and it is in Sanskrit which is a very difficult language to understand for the common man thus few men can understand its purport.

(2)   Professional reciters have created the impression that Shrimad-Bhagavatam deals only with Krishna’s rasa-lila and thus presented Krishna as a great woman-hunter.

(3)  Professional reciters have introduced bhagavata-saptaha, or seven-day readings of the Bhagavatam.

 

Then Prabhupada explains that under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s Chaitanya-bhagavata, for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Krishna, Lord Chaitanya and Nityananda. Due to misunderstanding Shrimad-Bhagavatam, people are misled regarding the science of Krishna. However, by reading Shrila Vrindavana dasa Thakura’s book one can very easily understand this science.

          

So it is pretty clear that Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is a great book to introduce to the common people who normally may not have the required intelligence & patience to understand the most elaborate Shrimad-Bhagavatam

        

Also Shrila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has said said that Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important than Chaitanya-charitamrita for the common man because it is a lila-grantha. Without describing so much about philosophy, it describes the lila of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and is therefore easy for the common man to follow and understand the philosophy. Even though Sarasvati Thakura himself mostly explained philosophy, he said that philosophy is only for the greatly learned people, and for the common men Chaitanya Bhagavata is more important. So he said, """"Read Chaitanya Bhagavata from time to time."""" If anyone came to him he would ask them if they had read Chaitanya Bhagavata. He often asked people this, including non-devotees. He recommended that for ordinary people, the first Vaishnava literature they read be Chaitanya Bhagavata.

 

Q.Then why did not Shrila Prabhupada explicitly tell us to read this book and distribute it in mass quantities?

 

A.    One immediate answer is because Shrila Prabhupada had not translated the book. Shrila Prabhupada did give great importance to Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s pastimes that is proved by the fact that he left the translation of the Bhagavatam in middle to complete Shri Chaitanya-charitamrita. So actually he did’nt have time to translate Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata. Although Prabhupada has said that his books are enough, he did say that reading Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata will be a great aid for the common man, that one should read this book if he has to preach the gospel of Lord Chaitanya, that readers will profit much by going through Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata (SB Intro). So I would say that it is not against the teachings of Prabhupada to introduce this book with the original Bengali verses & translation to the common people.

 

Q.   But the translation is not done by Prabhupada. So how will we know whether it is bona-fide?

 

A.    Shri Chaitanya-bhagavata is full of very simple but very sweet Bengali verses which are very easy to translate into any language if the devotee translator is  little intelligent and has a little knowledge of Bengali (which is very easy to get). There are very few Sanskrit verses in the whole book and some of them are from the Bhagavatam. For example, translation into Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu etc. is very eas",0

However, it does say """"GUI Improved: new option in advanced setting page: query task comment and snapshot info automatically""""
Disabling these two new options make it possible to seize all contact to BitComet servers.

 Calling for a movement to eliminate Biritsh spelling on wikipedia 

This is a very serious issue that needs to be confronted. It is not professional, non-NPOV, and inconsistent that we have some articles with British spelling, and others without. There are even some articles that deal with something thats exclusively American, such as the White House for example, that have some words spelled the British way. This should not be, and there should be some uniformity if we wish to have a professional and reliable encyclopedia.

Britian is the only English-speaking country that uses their own unique variation of the English language, and in British contexts, that's usually fine. But every other English-speaking country used the standard spelling, which is generally based on how the word actually sounds, and that should be the standard that Wikipedia uses. It makes absolutely no sense to use one country's variation of dialect, no matter how BIG, important, or """"popular"""" it is, and completely disregard the rest of the English-speaking world's orrect usage of the language. 

In fact, pretty much every article that contains a word that differs between the two dialects, the British version is favored. This, also, makes absolutely no sense. If the majority of a population speaks and/or writes a certain way, then it's institutions, endorsements, and websites should speak/write that certain way, too. It is understandable if this website was: www.wikpedia.co.uk, because that assumes that this is a primarily UK website. But, this website is: www.wikipedia.com, so it should follow the standard dialect that other """".com"""" use. 

This isn't in any way some sort of hate movement or opinion. This is an encyclopedia, and in encyclopedias, information must be consistent and reliable. Please take your time to think about this issue, for the uniformity of this encyclopedia will help ensure that the current and future quality standards will be upheld.

Sorry, Dennis, but this doesn't convince me. You're saying that a Wikipedia visitor can """"check facts"""" for themselves by checking the sources, but this simply presupposes that the source is correct. It sounds like you're telling me that if I write an article referencing the Sump website, then that's just my opinion and it's unverifiable. But if someone else writes an article referencing the Sump website, then that IS verifiable, and that makes it okay. Well that sounds daft to me. It makes more sense to examine the preponderance of evidence and listen to counter arguments, albeit in the form of links). I simply don't accept the assertion that just because something is published, it's reliable, and if it's not reliable, it's a """"soft fact"""". It's just opinion. Yes, published articles are verifiable, but so what? An alternative system would be one where the Wikipedia author looks at other (offered) articles, examines them for credibility and rationality (even if the article contradicts the existing orthodoxy), and then decides whether to include a given link. But the boot-strapping system as employed by Wikipedia is illogical and is not likely to produce accurate or reliable articles. It's just as likely, if not more likely, to propogate misinformation. I won't be editing the Ariel page. Ultimately, faith underpins everything, not least the credibility of verifiable sources. If the Ariel page is wrong now, which it is, then it's will stay wrong for some time - and if that doesn't illustrate the fundamental weakness of the """"verifiability"""" dogma, then I don't know what does.""",0

Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it? Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak. It's been on par with the other 3 for years. Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights.

This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years. A policy you, being so dumb, don't even understand.

1080,"Regular disclaimer on vandal User:Rovoam 

Dear fellow Wikipedians,

This IP is just one of a whole army of anon IPs used by a well-known vandal User:Rovoam, who without exagerration deserves to be included in the history of Wikipedia as THE most persistent and obsessed vandal that has appeared in Wikipedia so far.

This person has been extremely persistent and obsessive in vandalizing numerous Azerbaijan and Turkey-related entries, such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, Arran (Azerbaijan), Urartu, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan (disambiguation), Turkey, Kura-Araxes culture, Nakhichevan, Safavids, Karabakh, Khojaly, Khojaly massacre, Stepanakert, Khankendi, Ganja (city), Baku, Demographics of Azerbaijan, .az History of Azerbaijan, Azerbaijani language, Azeri, Caucasus, History of Turkey, Oghuz Turks, Ottoman Empire, Turks, Ottoman Turks, Turkic languages, Turkic peoples, Mannaeans, List of Azerbaijanis, and even Template:Europe (removing Azerbaijan and Turkey from the list).

He also vandalized user pages and talkpages, including User:Tabib, User:Tony Sidaways, (user page and talkpages), User talk:Rdsmith4, User talk:CryptoDerk  (talkpages), User:Weyes, User:Dante Alighieri, User:Chanting Fox.

Since the person uses wide range of IPs, it is virtually impossible to stop him by blocking. In the past he's been blocked numerous times but each time returned with a new IP. That's why the admins chose to vprotect most of the above mentioned pages (some of them more than once).

Rovoam started his actions in Wikipedia from introducing nationalistic POV edits in Nagorno-Karabakh yet back in February 2005. His aggressive discussion behaviour, unilateral un-agreed changes to the entry, and most importantly malicious tricks and manipulations with the history logs have quickly caused a conflict involving him and several other editors, with myself being his major opponent. 

The conflict was formally decided after Arbitration committee placed him under one-year revert limitation and personal attack parole . However, this decision made Rovoam even more radical and obsessive, as he kept to deliberately vandalize and disrupt Wikipedia, perhaps out of his personal feeling of hatred towards me (?for exposing him and proving him wrong?..). 

This person is very wily and smart which makes him rather dangerous. He is not the usual sort of vandal, but is rather knowledgeable in what he's dealing with. He could have been very valuable for Wikipedia if not his intentions and vandalisms. Rovoam is very able in manipulating with people by playing on history logs and various other means. His edits sometimes are misleading and not obvious. 

As I have numerously stated in my communication with a number of other editors including but not limited to User:Tony Sidaway, User:Codex Sinaiticus, User:Isomorphic, User:Who, User:Dbachmann, the only way effective to deal with this person is for other editors to unite and withstand all his spurious edits and vandalisms. Only then will he understand the whole senselessness of his actions.

 Assyrian propaganda on Wikipedia 
Is this the way how you handle problems on Wikipedia by simply closing the case without finding a compromise? What happens, if I put Aramean continuity related topics to the """"Assyrian people"""" article and everything will be deleted or distorted by Assyrian fascists again, because they think they are the owner of this article? They even have a WikiProject called Assyria and don't care about neutrality and support Assyrianism. We are fed up that all our contributions on Wikpedia even with references are getting removed  without a valid reason. Are you there to check it and undo it? This is why I was in favour for a neutral common page called Assyrian/Syriac people, Syriac people or whatever focused only on our Christian heritage, where we all agree on. What's wrong with the idea to create articles within a common page to express each groups views? The current Assyrian people article mixed up with Assyrian plus Aramean topics would led to edit wars again.

 Creation and Destruction 

I wanted to respond earlier, but I wasn’t sure if I should ever address you again, because you seemed very offended.  But I find you an interesting subject.  You’re a computer programmer like me, (but more advanced), you have a semblance of devotion, as far as I can tell, and you like KJV like me.  If I have offended you, then I hope you will accept my apology.

The bible does say a lot of things about the motivations of people, and I really didn’t intend to direct any verses at you personally.  I really want to have a prophet's eye view of the human race.

When I saw the discussion I noted that evidence was being given by both sides, and I felt a desire to step outside of that perspective for a bit and give my own testimony of how the Lord has led in my life concerning these issues.  Since the time I wrote that I have had a fascination to study Creation Science, and I have had some overwhelming discoveries; treasures which I would like to share.

Matthew 13:52  Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe [which is] instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man [that is] an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure [things] new and old.

Before I began to gather research, I suspected that there was already tons of evidence that would easily bury the Evolution Theory because it is a man-made theory designed by atheists to conveniently do away with moral responsibility to an intelligent Creator.  I realized that Adolf Hitler was huge fan of Evolution and thereby thought he was doing a good thing for mankind by eliminating the Jews, (but he only killed ~6 million).  Next on his list was the blacks.  His intention was to take over the whole world and progressively eliminate “inferior” races.  Of course there have been many other attempted genocides in the cause of progressing humanity by eliminating “weaker” races.  Some people may still sympathize with this cause.  We would call these racists and Neo-Nazis.  

“At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace, the savage races throughout the world.”  Charles Darwin, The descent of Man, chapter 3 and World Book Encyclopedia 1852, p. 336
“thus from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of higher animals, directly follows.”  Charles Darwin The Origin of Species… p. 243
“The standard of intelligence of the average adult Negro is similar to that of the eleven-year old youth of the species Homo sapiens.”  Henry Fairfield Osborn – Outspoken evolutionist and Curator of The American Museum of Natural History, New York
“No rational man, cognizant of the facts, believes that the average Negro is the equal, still less the superior, of the white man.”  Thomas Huxley (known as Darwin’s bulldog) 1871
Here’s a “theistic” evolutionist: “The Black People of Australia, exactly the same race as the African Negro, cannot take in the gospel… All attempts to bring them to a knowledge of the true God have as yet failed utterly... Poor brutes in human shape… they must perish off the face of the earth like brute beasts”  Kingsley C. Sermons on Natural Subjects Sermon XLI pp. 414-17, 1886, Charles Kingsley, an Anglican Priest who promoted Darwin.

A lot of people seem to feel more free if they convince themselves there is no Creator, but that people have evolved and just make their own gods and religions.
 """"With this single argument the mystery of the universe is explained, the Deity annulled, and a new era of infinite knowledge ushered in.”  Ernst Haeckel (“The Riddle of the Universe,” 1899, p. 337.) (This guy must have been high on PCP or something.  The theory he was explaining assumed that living cells are very simple.  This was before molecular biology.)
 “I suppose the reason we leaped at The Origin of Species was because the idea of God interfered with our sexual mores.” Thomas Huxley
 “I had motives for not wanting the world to have meaning; consequently assumed it had none, and was able without any difficulty to find satisfying reasons for this assumption.  For myself, as no doubt for most of my contemporaries, the philosophy of meaninglessness was essentially an instrument of liberation. The liberation we desired”  Aldous Huxley

But I’ve already explained why fallen man would want such a thing, and at the start I suspected, though I had not done so much research yet, there was already overwhelming evidence to verify the biblical account of creation and the flood.  Discussing the evidence may persuade some, but never all.  Jesus made it plain that no amount of evidence will persuade those that are not willing to be persuaded.

The DH article was fine as it was, concise, accurate, thorough. Recent edits turned it into an unreadable mess, which repeated information over again, was unnecessarily complex in it's layout, had entire paragraphs copied from the new DH trades, had section headers that weren't populated, had info box fields that were totally irrelevant to the character. If a little bit of new information that is useful got lost in the process, that's because the article was so messed up I only had time to fix the main issues. I figured someone else could fix the little bits remaining if they wanted, like you for example.

Well, opposing viewpoints frequently meet in wikis.  """"Neutral"""" POV and """"common sense"""" are highly subjective and the only solutions are to either favour one viewpoint as a matter of site policy or to let people battle it out.  If you choose the former approach, admins need to monitor contributions very carefully.  If the number of contributors is large, you have to police the site through very """"blunt"""" use of editing restrictions (massive IP range blocks, night editing restrictions etc) which slows the development of the wiki considerably.  If you choose the latter, editors are allowed to run free and the project grows quickly.  However, you can end up with long, protracted debates between editors about seemingly trivial points.

Wikipedia was founded on the principle of allowing very open editing with minimal intervention by admins, and I doubt that will ever change.  You can console yourself with the fact that all of the millions of articles here can be copied freely (under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license) to other wiki projects and edited to suit the viewpoint of the site!

 You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! Gurubrahma, please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier: 

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8.

 No personal attacks 

Hi there TripWire, though I understand that you may have strong opinions about Balochistan, or Pakistan, or both, resorting to personal attacks as you have here where you mock another user's English skills, or here where you attempt to denigrate another user by calling him a little girl, are not constructive. (I'll also point out that calling someone a """"little girl"""" is sexist because you are implying that girls are inferior to boys.) If you wish to participate in serious discussions like this, you need to keep a level head, and you can't resort to name-calling. Comment on the content, not the contributor. Insulting other editors only makes you look bad. And if I were you, I'd also consider removing """"LOL"""" and """"Haha"""" from your toolbag, as laughing at other editors is bound to irritate them.

 Russian and Indian economies 

If you check the the numbers, you will see that on most economical measures Russia has a larger GDP than India, such as nominal GDP. As nominal GDP represents total market value, it is most frequently used when talking about superpowers. India has a larger PPP GDP, but Russia has a much higher per capita GDP than India in both categories. Overall, Russia has a higher HDI index. Your statement that India has a higher GDP than Russia is accurate in only a narrow sense and based on a single GDP calculation. 71.112.145.211  

India is way ahead of Russia in terms of GDP (PPP) (see List of countries by GDP (PPP)) and just behind Russia in terms of GDP (nominal) (see List of countries by GDP (nominal)). We are talking over here national economies and not just economy from per capita perspective. Also, India has a higher GDP growth rate than Russia (see List of countries by GDP (real) growth rate) and according to BRIC report, India's GDP (nominal) will be four times that of Russia's by 2050 and that is a very important factor considering this is an article on potential superpowers.   

 India is not way ahead of Russia, Russia is way ahead of India. Everything in India is Russian suchs as military arsenals, rockets, missiles, fight jets, commercial jets, ships, subs and etc. Russia is a superpower and India is not quite a superpower. There are many reasons why Russia is a superpower and that is a long discussion. Russia is the number military forces in the world and the worlds largest military arsenal builder. India is a big population and smart people but Russia is has unique things about it that India hasn't.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 78.129.197.69

Ok, Spitsbergen was the island and the archipelago's name for a long while. Then it was the Spitsbergen archipelago, and the main island became West Spitsbergen to distinguish it from the archipelago. The German spelling Spitzbergen was never a variant, just a mistake (I've said a thousand times) by authors who didn't or don't know any Dutch and/or know/knew little to nothing about the island's history. Greenland, Groenland, etc. were names that should only be referenced in a historical context, as they were also based on a misconception, and need not be mentioned in the lead. West Spitsbergen, as it was once known, should be mentioned in the lead, like any other standard name (not a """"variant"""", or a mistake like Spitzbergen/Greenland/Groenland).

4228,"Vandalism etc report against User:Signalhead

I'm not sure why it was incorretly made but I reproduce it here as requested.

I wish to make an allegation of persistent Vandalism against the owner of the account ‘Signalhead’ for repeated vandalism of articles, to which: deletion of material edited into those articles which Signalhead disagrees with their being there, such contributions being legitimate edits and not vandalism in themselves (other than Signalhead unilaterally deciding that he doesn't want them there).

The articles in question are on a railway subject matter and it is clear that Signalhead has unilleterally appointed himself as an ‘expert’ who has decided to ‘own’ the articles and persistently arbitrates on what material may or may not be edited into the article.  I refer in particular to three articles, 'Home Signal'; ‘Token (Railway Signalling)’ and ‘Signal Passed at Danger’ (And I must thank Signalhead himself for providing the evidence of that last article where he tried to use a claimed erroneous edit as evidence of a false claim of sockpupetry – it has become clear that another contributor (or even contributors) feel the same way I do).

Whenever edits are made to those articles, Signalhead has often just deleted (vandalism:blanking) the edit claiming the information is just wrong or ‘erroneous’ without permitting any discussion on the point.  Further the blanking takes place anything from a few minutes to a few hours which clearly demonstrates that Signalhead is watching the articles to make sure that no ‘unsuitable’ material is placed there and to ensure that he can delete any material which he believes is incorrect.  This demonstrates an arrogant ‘know it all’ attitude to other Wikipedia contributors and is, against the principles on which Wikipedia is based.  This unacceptable behaviour brings wikipedia into disrepute by discouraging legitimate contributors from actually contributing to the content of articles.

For my own part, I specifically refer to Signalhead’s blanking of an edit at 16:44 on the 15th September to article ‘Token (railway signalling)’, with an edit summary of ‘Removed Erroneous comments …’ because he thinks he knows better (vandalised within 4 hours).  Signalhead also vandalised the article ‘Home Signal’ at 11:42 27th October 2007 when he blanked an edit from another contributor in the article with the familiar ‘Reverted erroneous edit’ justification, within 3 hours of the contribution, again because he claimed to know better.  I reverted this blanking when I added an illustration that supported the blanked text.  However, Signalhead just vandalised the article again by blanking the edit at 17:07 on the 27th October 2007 with a ‘Reverted to earlier and better version’ justification, less than 2 hours after the restoration.  Signalhead did add something to the article discussion page, but regardless of that he had no right to just blank the contribution no matter how much of an authority he thinks he may be on the subject matter.  He should have discussed the matter first and then the article should have been adjusted by consensus.

I note that another contributor has also expressed exasperation with Signalhead's persistent blanking and adjudication of article content in a somewhat more unorthadox manner.

I offer the short times between contribution and blanking and the blanking itself as evidence that Signalhead is watching ‘his’ articles and deleting any ‘unsuitable’ (in his eyes) content.

With Signalhead’s apparent familiarity of finding his way around Wikipedia, I find it hard to believe that he is unaware of the rules.

I am all for mentioning Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister in the article, around the same place David Cameron is currently described as Prime Minister, but to put Clegg alongside the Queen and Prime Minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. Now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the Prime Minister's second-in-command, and if Cameron were to die/resign suddenly Clegg would become Prime Minister, I would completely agree that he should be there, but it isn't.

WTF are you talking about?  There is no admin decision against me to not edit gender articles.  I'm full allowed to edit any and all articles.  Not only are you engaging in slanderous accusations, you're telling flat out lies.  I'd say spreading flat out lies which have absolutely not basis in reality against other members is a violation of several Wikipedia policies, so you better be VERY careful about what you say.  I strongly suggest that you retract your slanderous accusation before you further discredit yourself.Why the heck would I make changes under an alternate account when I have the full capability of doing it under this account?  

Also, where have I inserted any kind of right wing or religious views here?  Nothing I've said has anything to do with religion nor does it have anything to do with politics.  My points are extremely valid and you only rejected them because of your ridiculous personal biases and need to push your POV.  Not only are transvestites not necessarily transgendered, there are quite a few people on this list who are clearly NOT transvestites even using the description given in the article itself.  I have to question how anyone thought it was a good idea to add them.  

I should also note that you're being hypocritical here, you're reverting a change on the basis that it hasn't been discussed, when you yourself refuse to discuss it!  I'd be very interested to know why a) non-transgendered people should be included on a list of transgendered ones and b) why transvestite is used as automatic criteria for seeing if someone is transgendered, even though there is nothing in the definition that indicates that.

Frankly, this kind of behavior is appalling.  The supposedly open minded LGBT Wikipedian cliques criticize """"right wing religious"""" people (and by right-wing religious that means anyone who doesn't agree with their extremist views) is actually one of the most close-minded groups on wikipedia, with the least likely chance of actually discussing things (as evidenced here) and least likely to consider others views.   29 June 2005 22:08 (UTC)""",0

There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π. Κυπατζήδες) and  believers of ultra nationalistic organizations of Greek “national interests”, as L.A.O.S. and Chrissi Avgi. They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community. Balkan history has labelled such people as GREKOMANS, a form of mental malignacy cited in Larousse dictionaries. Their illusion is MEGALI IDEA of Greek nationalism-expandism.They have been allied with Armenian, Serbian and Cypriot extremists of similar interest.

Safi is from Iran, where images of the Prophet are tolerated.

Cf. the discussion on pages 184–186 in the book by Carl W. Ernst (""""While Muslims in other countries might find this objectionable, it seems to cause no comment in Iran.""""). It is a question of proportion. Safi takes the view, as an Iranian muslim, that images of Muhammad are okay. They're part of the culture he grew up in.

That wasn't an attack (ad hominem), that was constructive criticism.  There's a difference.  """"You're an idiot,"""" is an ad hominem attack.  It is a baseless insult with no constructive intention.  """"Rubbish"""" is an ad hominem attack.  There is nothing constructive other than an insult of another contributors work.  Telling fiddle they he or she has an """"arrogant obtuse attitude"""" was constructive with the intention of advice on how to better deal with new posters.  """"Instead of posting rubbish"""" is both an arrogant and insulting statement.  It did nothing to help me create a better article, OR give reasons why the SKK article was being deleted.  """"Rubbish"""" is not an objective criteria.  """"This article has already been posted & debated"""" is.  Of course this fact never was brought up until after the discussion was well out of hand.

Second, you cannot with any intellectual honesty characterize what I posted as """"vandalism.""""  My repeated intention was to make a sincere contribution of a topic that I felt is important.  I was more than happy to discuss the merits of the article as evidenced by my fruitless attempt to use the """"hangon"""" tag.  I literally barely had time to type a few words before the article was again deleted with absolutely zero discussion or valid justification.  

I encourage ALL parties to go back and look at how this played out.  There was NO discussion other than threats & a dismissive suggestion to go play in your own sandbox.  Is this really how you want to run Wiki?  It is, after all, your playground, and you get to make the rules.  That's fine with me.

We can disagree on that assessment, but don't expect me to get on my knees with some """"gee, I'm sorry"""" obsequiesness just so I can join the cool kids club.

Reply to vandal Wakkeenah
To all the vandals and so called just administrators, the air dates are minor problems, the facts and details surrounding Reeves suicided are not being written well enough, as everybody else is reporting, the fact that Reeves was to fight Moore next day, is also being reverted, this is pure vandalism. As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts.""",1

5,"Originally born in OHIO,and raised on a yuppie farmh in a small town outside of dayton, ohio. Her mother is a professional and has worked for the government for almost 30 years and her father is retired.   Traci was raised on staage at the age of 2 starting with ballet then tap, then jazz.... she was a natural on stage..... throughout her childhood she was in pagaents and sport like softball, volleyball and track in high school, she competed in many events: Miss Wright State of OHIO,All American Drill Team.

After Traci graduated, her love of dance and people took her to a business college, where she studied basics in business management.  Then she learned ins and outs of banking and later took on another degree in Medical Techology. She also did promotional work for , bartended , ran local bars and competed in bikini contests for extra funds.

In 1996, Traci started lifting weights with a friend and saw a photo of Marla Duncan winning a national competition. Her beauty and physique impressed her enough that she wanted to try what she was doing - Fitness Competitions. At the time she was developing some problems medically and noticed herself gaining some weight.   Traci thought weight training would help but she found that because she is a natural she responded almost imediately to the weights which caused her to get pretty stocky and very strong quick.  She was still eating normally but when it comes to bikini contests you need to be lean and feminine.... well this is when the Army Soldiers took a noticed to her.  She was at Ft. Hood, TX and was left alone because a lot of times soldiers are away for months to years and she was pretty shy meeting others because she had always been very much independent.  So she decided to check out while in studies some competitions related to the Army.  This is where she found out about obstacles course contests... so she knew she was strong and stocky so maybe this would be better for her.  So she entered her first WTF competition with little or know training and out of 100 girls made nationals in top 10. but something happened ... she started noticing her weight wasn't changing and she was developing back problems and fatigue.   She had always had problems with being healthy as a kid and seemed to get sick a lot.  Her Father was always on her about bundling up.  One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down. So she reenrolled in school again for more college degrees towards nutrition in NC.   Up until 2002 she only competed for fun, not as a money making career. In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s",0

 Lasvegasflash ban 

Just a few comments on this action.
First let's say I have been in this guy's boots. Admins start revertinng your edits with no explanation and no explanation of who they are or their capabilities. After participating in other forums and various social activities around the Internet one learns to just ignore this as crap and trolls wanting to exert their ego trips on you. You removed the history of the warning revision summary on his talk page but after reviewing the talk page revisions, I think I understand what may have happened. I sympathise for the guy as I have been there myself and with one of the same personalities involved, too. I would guess he (LasVegasflash) thought he was doing a good thing for wikipedia and did not understand why his links were considered spam and everybody else's were good. Then enter a few editors with histories of kicking people, not summary commenting with any details, and then he, either becomes defiant, or just ignores the """"trolls"""" harrassing him. Sound familiar from other kicked editors?

Admins need to identify themselves!!!
Templates are too mean spirited when no user friendly comments are added to them!

My feeling is the permanent ban was too harsh. Review his edits. He has contributed a fair bit of information and time. This demonstrates caring from the guy. He just seems ignorant and needs a lesson from somebody. This won't be the first time I have been harrassed or banned from attempted compassion....LOL. Your call. I am a newbie.

PNRS, human. PNRS, human. PNRS>human. The only problem is that your analogy at this point no longer correlates to the real-world thing it was supposed to analogize. It isn't that we have detected PNRS's twice and found they were generated by humans, therefore the third PNRS we detect is probably human. Rather, the real world knowledge that we have around how life developed on Earth would describe an analogy that says we detected several PNRS's, and they all turned out to be generated by natural phenomenon. Somewhere in the ID article, it says that ID is not meant to replace (insert laundry list of evolutionary bits and pieces), and that those bits and pieces have already been shown scientifically to be part of a natural process. Those are PNRS's that were proven to be generated by an odd arrangement of pulsars, not alien lifeforms. The flagella on bacteria is just another PNRS in this analogy. And while we may not scientifically be able to explain them yet, we have several other complex PNRS's that we know were created naturally, so rather than leap to the conclusion that """"a designer created flagella"""", science says """"no further information known"""". There's a concept that feels like you aren't grasping here: science is patient in the face of an unknown. science deals with the unknown all the time. But just because something is unknown doesn't mean science finds it neccessary to leap to a conclusion or redefine itself. natural science has defined itself as empirical, observable, repeatable knowledge. And that's worked pretty good for the last couple of centuries, even though when the first natural scientists came about, they knew practically nothing, and everything was unknown from a rigorous, scientific point of view. If one were to look at ID from a purely scientific point of view and ignore all the political intent, ID is so impatient """"to know"""" that it discards centuries of scientific practices to find some answer based on subjective measures like """"legitimate possibility"""" or """"probable explanation"""".

Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is a R&B; and pop singer, songwriter, record producer and occasional actress of the 1990s and 2000s. Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.

Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.

Biography and music career
Early life and discovery
Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (né Núñez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song """"And They Call the Wind Maria"""", from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.

Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.

In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.

 Editing on Hypertension 

Hi DocJames, 

As a long time wikipedia watcher, I feel like I'm talking to a celebrity here after seeing your name on so many medical pages. I'm a medical student who uses wikipedia very frequently, and now that I'm getting to the end of my training I'd love to be able to contribute back to the encyclopedia that got me through my training. 

As you can see, I'm fairly new to the editing scene, so any guidance you can give me would be much appreciated. Regarding my recent edits on the Hypertension article, as I mentioned in the """"talk"""" page I'm basically trying to find a way to get rid of the """"daunting wall of text"""" problem that I feel the article has at the moment. I'd like to preserve all the hard work that others have done on providing detailed research, but to try to keep the page as something that even people who got diagnosed with hypertension and are wondering """"what's that?"""" can browse with relative ease. As such, I feel that the best way to go forward is to preserve the highly detailed content (most of which is only relevant to medical professionals) on specific pages, and keeping the sections of this page down to a few short paragraphs summarising the most relevant points. Let me know what you think about this approach, and please modify my submissions or revert them as you see fit.

 Robert Sapolsky and shamanism 

Shouldn't Robert Sapolsky's theory about shamanism and schizotypalism as the source of schizophrenia be mentioned here? He is clearly a notable source on this subject. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwAQqWUkpI 173.17.92.242  
Before anyone else objects to Youtube as a source, I'll point out that this is Sapolsky giving a lecture. That said, this strikes me as a better fit for Causes of schizophrenia#Evolutionary psychology than here. It's a very speculative theory, albeit from a clearly notable commentator, with little experimental evidence, and it also focuses on what he calls schizotypical personality disorder, and not on schizophrenia per se.

I had a chance to go through the lead a bit just now, and agree that material from the last paragraph. There is also the point that national syndicalism predates WWI. I also made everything consistently past tense with respect to the movements per se, leaving only the discussion of ideology in the present tense.
Obviously there's more that can be done, but there has to be sources and the lead has to be summary style. In this regard, I noticed that the material (removed) in the following passage was not only unsourced, but not mentioned at all in the main body of the text. I am familiar with the discussions on monumental architecture and the like, but there has to be reliably sourced materialpreferably in the main body of the articleto be summarized in the lead.Fascist movements emphasize a belligerent, virulent form of nationalism (chauvinism) and a distrust of foreigners (xenophobia), the latter closely linked to the ethnocentrism of many fascist movements. The typical fascist state also embraced militarism, a belief in the rigors and virtues of military life as an individual and national ideal, meaning much of public life was organized along military lines and an emphasis put on uniforms, parades, and monumental architecture.

 Really? 

YOU'RE CONTRADICTING YOURSELF! Basically your opinion of based on blindness and bullshit as far the """"evidence"""" you send me are considered.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

Thank you for your reports at Wikipedia:Administrator intervention against vandalism. I find that you are a reliable contributor, and frequently make useful reports. However, you do sometimes seem a little too quick to jump straight to final warnings and AIV without milder warnings first. It is certainly not necessary to always go through the whole sequence of level 1 warning, level 2, level 3, level 4, but in almost all cases there should have been at least a couple of warnings, and an immediate """"final warning"""" to a new user without previous warnings should be reserved for extreme cases, such as serious personal attacks. One other point is that it is worth thinking whether """"vandalism"""" is always the right label. For example, you warned and reported Brendo1337 for vandalism, but to me his/her editing looked more like experimenting than vandalism, and a word of advice to experiment in the sandbox instead of an article may perhaps have been sufficient. I certainly do not wish to put you off, as you make very useful contributions to vandal fighting, as I have already said. However, you may find it helpful to consider my suggestions.

Forgive me if I try to be brief. It's very early in the morning here, and I haven't slept yet. It's understandable that you didn't know of any active projects connected to WP:CVG when you made your proposal - It's not as if any of us are being paid to be here, are we? Now that I know why we weren't told, I don't have a problem with that part.

I'll read over the current proposal sometime today. I didn't respond to your comments at WP:MK because the previous discussion of the MK template split (which I was involved in) raised issues brought up in your proposal (that's how we were told). I believe that the main concern we had was over the ease of navigation, so the changes were reverted. I still have the same concerns about your proposal. Other WP:MK members may still share this opinion, have other issues, or are not bothered. That's why I've asked you to discuss your plans for the MK template with (the rest of) us before you proceed.

Personally, I agree with the aesthetic changes you're proposing, but I disagree with the severe limit on links in the template. The characters article you linked to was a good start, but it does no harm to link to some more categories that are related to the series, if only to make navigation more convenient. That's all that I'm prepared to say while I'm half-asleep, but if you have any more questions for me personally, I'll respond when I'm able to.  07:16",0

 Heavily biased section named as Death on 18 August 1945 

The bias in the section named as Death on 18 August 1945, is very much conspicuous, very much unbecoming of Wikipedia. There is a literary effort to establish unconfirmed events in the veil of so-called """"scholarly opinion"""".  It appears the page is intentionally silent on the report of the last commission and the inquiry commission by Taiwan Government, the country in which the air crash was alleged to take place. It is another matter, but quite relevant, that Taiwan itself has denied this crash having ever taken place.  But what is most irritating is the last paragraph, where there is a emphasis on shock, disbelief at so-called death in India, which gives a lead into a suspicion that everything (even an Inquiry Commission report perhaps!) are all babies of this disbelief.  There are pictures like Renkoji temple, or newspapers reports published at that time which unsuccessfully try to uphold the the death theory, but keeping silent on the other theories, increases the suspicion of a using this page as a tool to publish own opinions rather than information.

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!

 Northern Cyprus edits 

I will complement you on doing a great job updating and expanding many Northern Cyprus-related articles.

I oppose, however, to your sneaky removal of links to Cyprus / Island of Cyprus / Republic of Cyprus, usually replacing them with links to Northern Cyprus, sometimes even making double or triple links to NC to avoid linking to the island of / Republic of Cyprus. I also notice that all your newly created articles about places in NC do not have any mentions at all about  RoC, not even the de jure/de facto distinction. That is definitely POV editing.

I oppose also to your consistent removal of any mention of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, replacing any mention with """"the events of 1974"""" or your new favorite """"the hostilities of 1974"""". These euphemisms do not give any information to the user of Wikipedia, they only create questions: """"Which events?"""", """"Which hostilities?"""". You have also been removing many sourced descriptions of the local effects of the 1974 ínvasion. These edits are definitely disruptive POV edits.

In your edit summaries you never mention the removals and changes you do to the article content, you only mention additions of mayors, population figures etc., which are obviously good additions. The disruptive edits I have mentioned above are never mentioned (which is why I used the word """"sneaky""""). To make it even worse, you are using false edit summaries. When you remove a category you do not like with an edit summary """"syntax"""", it is not only disruptive, it is plain dishonest.

In a week's time I will again be able to edit regularly in Wikipedia, and I will then begin to revert your POV edits. In the meantime you could help, by reverting your worst POV edits. If not, the least you can do is to refrain from any more POV edits with dishonest edit summaries.

I really think that it would be possible for us to work together to create a neutral (WP:NPOV) presentation of places in NC, but that would require that you are willing to accept that your personal POV is not necessarily the only way to describe the world. Regards!   """,0

Speedy deletion of Uxi
 A tag has been placed on Uxi, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Responses:
1 - I was not referring to this, only your posts on Wikipediocracy recently.
2 - I was not referring to these events dating back to 2009, it does not appear relevant to your actions now.
3 - I am sure people can refer to the Arbcom case for the facts if they wish. I did review the situation with a sitting Arbcom member before starting RFA, as you are aware.
4 - This is the first time I have heard about it. It seems a bit late to be digging this up now.
5 - I know nothing about this, your page was not even on my watch-list until today.
6 - No, I was not even aware of """"revenge nominations"""". If I ever commented in a DR related to this, it was not as part of any pattern and I do not recall ever doing so. I do not watch everything you do on Commons, nor did I watch everything Russavia did. I am not Russavia, nor do I take responsibility for his actions. If you wish to have my help on Commons, please leave me a note there.
7 - I briefly looked at 's contributions to assess if he was active as an OTRS volunteer on Commons. The copyright violations seemed blatant to my eyes, shocking for an OTRS volunteer granting verification tickets to images. This was self-evident even looking at the first 20 thumbnails, some of which had been marked as copyright problems previously. Commons is short of experienced copyright reviewers, when we spot problems we ought to mark it for review, it is not like I was deleting them on sight, I am leaving the review to others. If you wish to discuss Ktr101's uploads to Commons, I suggest that happens on Commons.

Your 7 responses appear to avoid the central issue, which is how you are now using Wikipediocracy to hound me. You appear to be making statements based on a time when you had privileged trusted rights and using this history to paint the worst picture of me possible. If you have allegations to make, please make them directly to me as you have above and at least then I can ask you to link to the sources for any assertions you make and respond to those facts.

Again, you are digging through history, some of which is 7 years old and the most recent is now 3 years old. It would be good if we could both move on rather than rehashing all this nasty crud, most of which I have forgotten as I have been busy with a great deal of positive work since.

My quibble was the use of the word """"automatic"""".  This suggests, to me, something that happens without human intervention, which surely cannot be the case.  A visa cannot issue itself, law or no law.  The system that issues visas must be informed of the visit of the royal personage, and that information can only be provided by a human.  Effectively, someone, somewhere, has to decide to approve the issuing of this visa, and after that the system does what it needs to do.  To cause such a visa to be denied might be unprecedented and unthinkable, but surely someone, somewhere, has such a hypothetical power.  That it may never be used still does not make the issuing of the visa """"automatic"""", in my understanding of the word.   """,0

3964,""":::::: The numbers are indeed possible. First is that the numbers from the 1997 election cannot be used to compare to the current one becuase this was before the point in which the youth would take on a much bigger position than they did today. the conservatives were still around and the youth could not vote then, but now the youth can vote and the conservatives have either died or changed to rather anti-Ahmadinejad. The conservative candidate was nothing like ahmadinejad so he could have had a good 8 million votes. And if you add Rezaee votes with it it comes around 9 million for the consevatives in total. 60% of iran is under 30, and they only know problems under this regime or more specifically, this administration. Besides Ahmadinejad is massively unpopular and the numbers from his previous election are going to decrease because of the increase in sanctions and further isolation from the rest of the world. YOu cannot think that his approval will go up because the nuclear program was started long before ahmadinejad, he just publicized it and his threats against Israel further promoted them, He makes useless provocations against the Holocaust, going as far enough to invite David Duke to tehran to talk about it, and this is not going to promote him very well. Next, most of the programs in Iran were started in the Khatami or even Rafsanjani administration. so the fact the claim that he is supporting the poor is dubious and the Iranians realize this because he has slowed them down or stopped them wholly, in order to pay russia or the military. And he has also placed Gas rationing on one of the largest producers of oil in the world. Point, being Ahmadinejad is not going to be quite popular, even within the conservative corners of the government. Karroubi is popular where ahmadinejad supposedly is so I dont see anything wrong with his votes and the upper class and middle class are going to vote for mousavi. Some of the lower class are going to vote for mousavi since they remember his handeling of the economy in the 80's so that will give him lots of extra votes. Rezaee is still really hated due to his running of the revolutionary guard in the 80's. And do you think that the government was going to tolerate a runoff between two reformists that each got more votes than the conservatives combined. Absolutely not in a million years. So the numbers are reasonable as mentioned above. Next is that you cannot rely on polls in Iran or whatever any government group is going to say. The polls that are """"official"""" are made by the government. you know what I mean. and the groups (the islamic participation front) cannot know the exact extent of their popularity because the people fear evin if the open their mouths.

Second point is that i might have contradicted myself earlier. Any memo that is made by the government is going to have the seal on it, making it offical, period. It does not have any numbers in order to prevent trails as I mentioned Earlier. 
Im going to leave this on the page. The first reason is that the letter, wheather fake or not, is being widely circulated around Iran, so it is being used as a catalyst to the protests. The second is that Wikipedia is not a forum in order to determine wheather or not a document is fake or not, If the document is of encyclopedic value, as it is being actively used within the situation as it is in the protests it should be kept. wheather it is fake or not, It is evidence that is being actively used there is vote rigging, (Talk)

1147,""":The PC 1 gradation could or not show Neolithic influence. I have already provided links that strongly suggest that it is very unlikely. Part of it could be Neolithic and part of it could be much more ancient. If it were Neolithic, it would have its lowest gradient in Atlantic Europe, where Neolithic was weakest and most tardy, yet it doesn't. PC 4 instead does. Whatever RR says, it's not so clear how to read some of these PCs, all but PC 3 (likely IE) and PC 5 (clearly Basque) rise more questions than give clear answers. 
Neolithic genetic influence doesn't need to be not European in origin. European Neolithic started in Thessaly and the alleged links with West Asia (particularly beyond Turkey) are rather unclear. So PC 1 could perfectly be part of the Paleolithic European inheritance, maybe reinforced with new Neolithic input too. 
PC 4 is weakest precisely in the less """"Neolithized"""" areas of Europe: Britain, Britany and Basque Country. Greeks definitively did never colonize anything outside the Mediterranean shores, so the explanation of RR is very weak. It may not say who's """"more European"""" (Balcanic peoples are clearly European however you look at it) but it may say who's more neatly Western European genealogically. It is very concordant with Y-DNA, btw. 
PC 3 (Indoeuropean probably) also shows a gradient and this shows who is more Western European too (in this case Basques and Iberians). This pattern is curiously inverted by PC 5. 
PC 1 and PC 2 instead show less clear patterns, what surely implies they are older and have hitchhiked other migrations if anything. They do show some correlation with SW Asia and NW Asia respectvely and they make up the 50% of European genetic pool (while the other three together only add up to 23%). 
PC 2 patterns show as much Asian influence as PC 1 and they can well be seen as a complementary, one centered in NW Asia and the other in SW Asia, both decreasing towards the west, the same that happens with PC 3 and PC 4. All 4 show historical Asian or Eastern European influence """"against"""" a nearly invisible Western core, best represented (maybe) among Basques. The pattern is pretty clear, the explanations maybe not so much. 
On the other hand the """"Basque"""" PC 5 is still strong in Eastern Europe but weakest in a central strip from Balcans to Scandinavia. 
So you tell me: which of these 5 components is more distinctly European if any? The more I think about it the more confuse it seems...
Why do you defend one tentative explanation of European genealogies over others? Do you have good reasons? Studies maybe? 
The only thing we know for sure is that all European lineages of all sorts, autosomal or halpoid, have links to West Asia. The weakest ones those that are +/- exclusive of Basque and Atlantic Europeans possibly. 
All European components are strong in West Asia. You want to make a one sided view of what is European but what those maps show if anything is that there are at least five sides and all are strongly present in Western Asia. 
Now it's your turn: show me what makes Europeans so distinct. You owe me that explanation and proof since long ago.
You have been obstructing this article from a viewpoint that you still are unable to prove beyond a most questionable dictionary quote. Give evidence or yield to reason.

I am seeking hot, kinky sex; that is why I am here.  I am seeking a large, hairy, ape-like man to discipline me.  I like it when big men talk dirty to me whilst pounding their rock-hard schingslongs into my mangina; just thinking about it makes my tiny little micro-penis perk up like Hitler on meth. I want a big, strong man to beat me up whilst another muscular hunk restrains me and whispers obscenities into my innocent little ear.  I especially like it when I am called 'a cum-guzzling, dick-sucking, fellating, felching, shit-sniffing, nigger-worshipping, homosexual man-slut,' for I know, in my heart, that this description of me is extremely accurate.  Please, big, hairy men, I want to be your ass-slave, serving you and satisfying you with my bunghole for as long as my submissive soul remains in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one1111won11  I will even pay you large sums of money if that is necessary.

 Outback gothic 

With this edit, an editor recently reinstated some text about Australian horror films. In the edit summary, it was stated """"First, a film doesn't have to be internationally famous to be part of the Australian film culture. Second, the theme of outback gothic has been dissembled for no reason because it listed a couple of less famous films."""" I took a look at the only citation in the reinstated text, and I see a key problem - it doesn't support the text in the article. The source doesn't support the sentence """"A major theme of Australian cinema has been survival in the harsh Australian landscape."""", it doesn't use the term """"outback gothic"""", and doesn't mention most of the quoted films, such as Wake in Fright, The Cars That Ate Paris, Shame etc etc. In fac the only sentence which the source supoprts is the one that was already in the article before the edit was made: """"Saw (2004) and Wolf Creek (2005) are credited with the revival of Australian horror."""" For now I am reverting the edit.

 The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis and the Unbroken Continuity of Sinn Féin Poblachtach since 1905 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?
Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necess",0

I moved the 69-72 Markham and Dixie championships from the Central B/Mid-Ontario to the Metro League, where they played.

DIXIE BEEHIVES 

(1957 - 1986)

Perhaps the first team to operate in the OHA under the Dixie name was the Dixie Staffords of the pre-Metro Junior 'B' Grouping that operated during the 1949-50 season. In 1952, the East York Rockets of the Metro grouping moved to become the Dixie Rockets. A few years later, the team changed its name to the Dixie Beehives. The Metro Junior 'B' Hockey League was a strong league and the Beehives were the league's most stable team. In 1972, a new Tier II Junior 'A' Provincial League was formed and the Dixie Beehives were one of six Metro teams to move up to the new league. The Beehives played in the league until 1986 when they ceased operations. The league managed to last only one additional season.

PATEY, Larry
Hockey
Born: March 19, 1953
Toronto, Ontario
Lary Patey played most of his young career in Mississauga, first in the Port Credit Hockey Association and later with the Metro Junior B Dixie Beehives. It was with the Beehives in March of 1971 that Patey suffered a near fatal accident during the Metro Junior B final against the Markham Waxers that Dixie would eventually go on to win in five games.

Hammered into the boards by 6- foot-6 defenceman Bob Dailey, Patsey slumped to the ice. While trying to get up, Patsey's teammate Rick Cornacchia took on Dailey in a tussle and the ensuing melee, Patey was caught in the face by a skate blade. 

From that horrific evening, Patey went on to a long and successful 12-year National Hockey League career as a centreman. After leading the Western League in scoring while with Sault Lake City Golden Eagles where captured rookie of the year honors, Patey was soon called up to the now defunct California Golden Seals. Later, Patey was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 1975-76 for Wayne Merrick and he concluded his career with New York Rangers before having to retire because of lower back injury.

A workaholic on the ice throughout his career, Patey later applied the same hard work ethic in the world of real estate and earned President's Club Honors as one of the Gundaker Better Homes and Gardens in St. Louis after only being in the business for four years.

While Patey had his most productive season offensively for California in 1974- 75 when he scored 25 goals to go along with 20 assists, it was during his stay with the Blues that the seventh-round draft choice drew the most attention for his strong two-way play.

""""St. Louis didn't care how many goals I scored- they had Red Berenson, Derek Sanderson and Gary Unger up front to do that. They wanted me to play defensively and aggressively."""" Patey combined both skills to set a St. Louis club record for most shorthanded goals in a season and was always called on to line up against the Bryan Trottiers, Bobby Clarkes and Phil Espositos of the NHL.

""""I enjoyed doing it because there was less pressure in having to score goals and I took a lot of pride in my role.""""

Living the life as a shadow, Patey did manage to score 153 goals in his 12 year professional career before retiring after the 1984-85 season.

While the league's fans didn't always notice Patey, or the fine job he did in shutting down opponents, his peers throughout the league certainly did.""",0

Well Maybe theres a reason it was taken off. I think its because her voice isnt as good as it used to be. but still I say her range is Bb2-G#7 but all that can be proven is a range of C3-G#7. C3 is the lowest note in My All, Emotions, You're So Cold, and I believe other songs. A1 is my lowest note and F7 is my highest and Im a Lyric Baritone. I don't know if Mariah has ever sang above the piano or in the second octave because there is no audio to prove it. All I know is alot of people exaggerate her voice alot. Notes should be checked before saying what they are. People start rumors about alot of things like the note in You're So Cold being G2. Its not. My way of checking notes is by using a keyboard. its pretty accurate too. Its better than a tuner. Tuners can be thrown off by the slightest extra sound. the best way to check a note using a tuner is to copy the note by singing it yourself. But keyboards are easy cause it wont produce a note an octave lower or anything as most people tend to do if they feel a note is too high or an octave higher if the note is too low. You should always check a note yourself and ask another person if you can rely on them.  06:27",0
