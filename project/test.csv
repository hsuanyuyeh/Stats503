Moreover, each configuration constitutes an abstract machine, which is itself a cellular automaton.  It is often the case that established practice is fraught with error.

 crosstheTs is back 

Futper, as promised, I've been working on a precise report on your editing habits (and have assembled a long record of diffs that seem to show you almost without fail push FYROM positions (highly improbable if you had a NPOV on the issue) I have also been reading up on Wikipedia's Administrator_Code_of_Conduct.

""""Admins are entrusted with additional abilities, but do not have special rights beyond those of regular editors. Like everybody else, admins are expected to behave in a civil manner.

Admins should also be aware that warning a user of a block, especially when the user has no prior history of problems, can be perceived as a threat. When dealing with otherwise good contributors, it may be advisable to make suggestions to their behavior without mentioning a block.

Reflecting on those words... I don't believe some of your intial words to me (which included ad hominem attacks me and threats to block me remotely match those standards).

""""Every sane person with normal adult intelligence can see that your allegations against B.F. are nonsensical. If you can't see that yourself, it's probably no use me trying to explain it to you. I will simply block you if you continue with this topic, for being either a malicious troll or too clueless for rational discussion""""

Also... I don't believe it was appropriate after I had made the initial anon complaint about you for you to block me (if you felt it was necessary it should have been left in the hands of another admin). The Wikipedia admin code of conduct clearly states this about admin conflicts of interests.

""""An admin should not block a user if they are not neutral with respect to that user, or have a conflict of interest""""

The reason why I'm asking is because I realize we both have strong POV on FYROM issues and that we got off on the wrong foot because of it. While I am preparing to push forward with a precisely itemized complaint against you (which I believe clearly shows inappropriate behavior towards me) I really don't want to go about this the long nasty way (which was why as a newb my complaint was anon until Beam started to unilaterally campaign to block me and reveal details) 

I would much prefer to save both our time by letting the matter drop but that would require your participation and assurance you will never again try to leverage your admin status as a tool to personally threaten me again. (surely others admins can handle it if it seems very necessarily to them) 

So what I really am asking here is are you willing to press the polite reset button and just stick to arguing points?   """,0

CJ DUB Keeps Calling Users Ignorant - Violation of Wiki Rules
Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor """"with experience"""". A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others. A wiki editor examines facts without judging others, as is the case in discriminatory environments. Therefore, he is not a wiki editor and is most likely a poser. He seems to be a sensitive american """"man"""" who feels everyone is against him or his american way of thinking. He must understand that not everyone will like him or his background. I have also noticed that another user named, Seb, may be the same person. He's probably using dual usernames in wiki. 
As a result of the above valid points, I urge blocking him for a long while so he learns to respect others on this forum. Again, he's broken wiki rules on respect for others 3 times. Thank you.

All Trayvon had to do is call the cops if he was soooo scared. 

The cops did NOT tell Zimmerman NOT to follow him. There's a HUGE diff btw a 911 operator and a cop. Telling someone 'we don't need you to do that' is NOT the same as a direct order and finally, Zimmmerman claims he DID stop following at that point.

If EIGHT BLACK TEENS were CAUGHT robbing people in that neighborhood, not to mention the ones that didn't get caught, then you'd have to be an IDIOT to not eyeball someone acting as suspiciously as Trayvon. For all we know, he could have robbed someone in the sub in one of his visits. We know the cops said he had a jewel-thieving tool.

 Hi, Pompous Ass!  ;) 

I know you think you're some kind of poker authority on Wikipedia, and that it's somehow your perogative to give the Imperial final thumbs up or thumbs down on what's acceptable regarding anything to do with poker here, but guess what? That's not the case. You are one of MANY arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of self-esteem builder, because here you can act like a """"big man"""", and make unilateral decisions on what's acceptable or unacceptable here.

The edits I have made (and will continue to make) on the Jack Straus entry regarding his death doesn't violate policy in ANY way. If I had the time or the inclination, I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used. You are simply a pompous ass who thinks you are the gatekeeper of anything poker-related on Wikipedia. You are not, and you will not censor me.

#2 Richard 20:53 20Feb
Yeah, so the problem as I see it, is that we still don't have a good number for how many Germans died in Poland except that maybe (according to http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=260621074909720), the max is 1 million (a number that is a little too """"round"""" for my liking).

Richard, you reading very carelessly. This is 1.1 in total not round million. Or do you ridicule the estimations at start? The """"a million"""" is because more easy was to estimate the total and the 1946-1950 loses from obvious reasons. Nobody can know exact number of deaths during flight, there was complete chaos. Who died was just buried on spot at road. Some graves disappeared just because were provisionally marked only. I remember some graves of even Polish soldiers on an edge of forest which disappeared in time. The wooden crosses just disintegrated. You do not believe because you are too young.

In any event, if you look at the numbers provided in Demographic estimates of the German exodus from Eastern Europe, you see 1,225,000 deaths in the """"Eastern German territories"""" and 263,000 in Poland for a total of 1,488,000 deaths which differs from Nitschke's estimates by about 500,000.

The 500.000 is big number, too big. I would believe in accuracy if the difference would be 100.000. But Nitschke could not count the East lost Polish teritories Kresy . Any way my goal is to separate the Flight number from Expulsion number.

If you take this downward revision of 500,000 and add it to the downward revision of 150,000 or so that the joint commission of Czech and German historians proposed, you can see how the ZgV's numbers of 2 million could be revised downards to 1 - 1.2 million which is what I believe Overmans is proposing. I don't understand the 500,000 figure yet.

 This counting I do not understand. You want see the most exact total number of deaths I suppose. What I attempt is to prevent such quacking like “Poland,…murdered millions of Germans.”. We have to assume that same individuals can be handicapped and can not read and write correctly and the info should be VERY simple.

What I'm still looking for is some indication of whether Nitschke, Haar and Overmans are widely accepted as right or if they are still the minority challenging the established majority opinion.

 In my opinion you contradict yourself. You always propagated multipoint POV. I always propagate logic and comparison. We can come closer to truth only by deduction and investigation. There will be always “minority challenging the established majority opinion” as you say. Beside not always majority is right, as you know Hitler was elected and supported by majority.

It would help if we could get some quotes that evaluate the work of these historians and puts them in context of the overall consensus of academic opinion.

If you have some idea how to do it I would try. From my experience in my professional field it is really difficult to get clue who of the researches is good and who barely satisfactory. You need to be professional yourself. Regularly scientific authors do not attack openly the opponent in scientific journals. They rather systematically attack opponent theories in extend period of time. In historical journals can be the same. Maybe you understand in this context that the academic opinion is not easy to grasp. Beside, quite often you need to know the scientists personal animosities. Some Wiki editor can be smarter then me and get multi pro and contra from popular press article on internet. Personally I do not trust popular newspapers there is too many errors and politic manipulations. I would consider “Google” type search in this point as waist of time. """,0

 section on resonant antennas misleading/got errors 
A lossless center-fed (needs to be mentioned) thin wire, lambda/2 (needs to be mentioned) dipole in free space (needs to be mentioned) has a feedpoint impedance of about 73 ohms, not 63 ohms. The discussion about operating at frequencies 20% above the first harmonic seems to assume that the radiation resistance would be unchanged; in fact it is increasing (the radiation resistance is a function of the ratio wire length/wavelength) - so the feedpoint voltage would go up, even in complete absence of a reactance. Also, the reactance of an off-resonance doublet depends on the diameter of the wire. A statement like """"about 150 volts of feedpoint voltage"""" is meaningless; depending on the wire size, the feed voltage could take an arbitrarily high value.  wh""",0

:This discussion is transcluded from Talk:University College London/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the reassessment.

{{#ifeq:|Talk||}}
 To uphold the quality of Wikipedia:Good articles, all articles listed as Good articles are being reviewed against the GA criteria as part of the GA project quality task force. While all the hard work that has gone into this article is appreciated, unfortunately, as of August 17, 2009, this article fails to satisfy the criteria, as detailed below. For that reason, the article has been delisted from WP:GA. However, if improvements are made bringing the article up to standards, the article may be nominated at WP:GAN. If you feel this decision has been made in error, you may seek remediation at WP:GAR. 

There are at least 5 broken links.

I'm concerned that some sections of this article look like a personal essay. For instance, from Student accommodation: """"Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates. The majority of second and third-year students and postgraduates find their own accommodation in the private sector. This is partly due to the fact that accommodation in and around Central London is often cheaper than university accommodation when shared with friends or flat-mates."""" Thay may well be true, but personal reminiscences are not suitable material for an encyclopedia article. Whose opinion is this? It needs to be either cited or removed.

I'm also concerned that almost the entire Alumni and academics section is uncited, and neither are sources provided in the main article to which this one links.

The present order of sections makes no sense, starting as it does with Academic reputation. Take a look at other university GAs such as University College, Durham or University of Bristol to get some ideas for a more logical presentation sequence.

The Notable buildings section needs to be converted to prose, and to focus on the notable buildings, not just list every building. It ought to be telling us something about these notable buildings, not just listing them.

The Student accommodation section is similarly largely just a list. This article is not supposed to be a brochure for University College.

The relevant pictures from the Gallery ought to be incorporated into the text at the appropriate places and the rest transferred to Commons with a link from this article.

The last three sections—Ethical investment policy, Filming at UCL, and University crest—do not contain enough material to warrant standalone sections.

Ref #85 is marked """"Suspended Domain"""", which makes me suspicious at the current status of UCL Biomedica.

Ok, my input here will probably be better received if I stay strictly serious. Some may even see me as a Zep hater, but it's quite the opposite. I've been a huge Zep fan for most of my life.

 I think the harcourt article is excellent, both because it provides additional context (particular in regards to the '19 and '28 weimar law), and in fact directly agrees to the basic premise of the argument.  It is widely accepted (harcourt, library of congress) that the early laws were targeted directly against the Nazis, and other paramilitary groups that were threatening, and attempting to overthrow the weimar republic. (The government having effectively disarmed by the surrender terms of wwI was unable to control the armed groups engaging in what we today would probably term gang warfare). As late as '32 Heinrich Bruening attempted to ban the SA and SS (see rise and fall of the 3rd reich) (Ironically setting up the situation that enabled the Nazis to legally take control). The subsequent laws enacted by Hitler were to a) rearm the nazis, in particular the private army SAs. 2) ensure familiarazation of  the about to be conscripted public with firearms usage. 3)ensure the  disarm all political opponents, specifically calling out jews.  Harcourt repeatedly and explicitly gives up the game - sure he disagrees with the NRAs use of nazi imagery in modern debate. Yes he says """"the nazi's were not in general pro gun control"""".  Both of those prior arguments are straw men, which do not in any way disprove the core history being argued - the core history which Harcourt specifically and explicitly admits to """"Hitler imposed regulations prohibiting Jewish persons from possessing any dangerous weaponsincluding firearms. The Nazi regime implemented this prohibition by confiscating weapons, including guns, from Jewish persons, and subsequently engaged in genocide of
the Jewish population"""" or """"To be sure, the Nazis were intent on killing Jewish persons and used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide"""". Nobody disagrees that Hitler armed his private army (SA, party), while disarming the people he was about to exterminate. Harcourt discusses this directly as well, quoting The Nazi minister of the interior """"“If these provisions guarantee that no enemies of the National Socialist state possess any weapons, then it is justifiable and appropriate to relax the current limiting provisions of the Weapons Law for the population faithful to the state"""". To  (Saul)WP:FRINGE You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. (/Saul) What part is fringe? That the nazis implemented gun control? That the gun control specifically targeted Jews? That there are a plethora of memos, diaries, and documents saying """"Go attack the jews, they are disarmed so you shouldn't have any resistance""""?

Problems with the article
Apparently this is a very loose term used to distinguish people who have acquired some kind of long term fame or notoriety associated with popular culture.  Hendrix, The Beatles, Elvis, Sinatra, Crosby, Jolson, and so on might be described as """"pop icons"""" because they are strongly associated with, and in some ways personify, the zeitgeist or an era in popular culture.  This includes film and other popular art forms, and sport (De Niro, Monroe, Bogart, Muhammad Ali, Pelé).   It often includes people who died relatively young (Morrison, Hendrix, James Dean).  So far so good.

Then there are people whose work wasn't primarily in or related to popular culture, but whose image has been co-opted as a pop icon (Einstein).  Well, okay.

Now looking at the article, we see a section called """"Notable pop icons"""" comprising, presently, some forty names.  More than half of those names are sourced from a single news story based on a press release produced by a single media organisation in November, 2003. A further seven of them are base on a similar news story from a different media organisation in 2005  The criterion for the list of 100 members given in the first news story, it turns out, is a viewer's poll by a single cable television channel, VH1, from a shortlist drawn up by """"A panel of celebrities and experts – including presenter June Sarpong, newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy and GQ editor Dylan Jones.""""  Presumably the experts on the panel asked to remain anonymous.

Further examination of that single source also demonstrates that there are unexplained omissions from our list.  If we assume for the moment that membership of the VH1 list (which is biased towards the tastes and cultural memory of the British viewership of that channel) is a sign of """"pop icon"""" status, where is Princess Diana on our list?  She's number 5 on the VH1 list but completely absent from ours.  Similarly, The Simpsons (VH1: number 6) and Robbie Williams (VH1: number 9) are omitted from our list.

Looking in the opposite direction, Aerosmith is included in our list because MTV  featured the band in a program called """"MTV icons"""", but is nowhere to be seen in the VH1 100 (not surprising as the band, while not unknown in VH1's target market, isn't exactly a household name).  And while VH1 lists first man on the moon Neil Armstrong at 76, his trumpet-playing namesake Louis Armstrong (selected as one of 100 """"Icons of the Century"""" by Variety) is nowhere to be seen on VH1's chart.

There are also problems with the membership criteria of the sources.  I've already mentioned the UK bias of the VH1 list (which goes some way to explain the presence of Beckham and Robbie Williams, both household names in the UK but not so well known elsewhere). The Variety list, for  instance, sought to represent """"every side of show business"""", so relatively obscure figures such as Arthur Freed (who wrote the lyrics for Singin' in the Rain and produced many hit films) are listed as """"Icons of the Century"""".  Clearly the people on the list are there because they're """"iconic"""" in some sense, but not in the sense implied by this article.

Another thing that isn't addressed is the requirement of longevity.  Can we include Britney Spears, who a mere decade ago was an unknown with a recording contract and an audacious concept for a pop video for her debut single? Britney Spears' career has hit an air pocket, and there's no way of knowing whether her image will recover in the public mind.  Perhaps it's premature to describe this relative newcomer as a """"pop icon"""".""",0

How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust.

See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Ormewood is correct that later revisions by someone (to put all wind considerations into one section) caused a loss of continuity. I was the original author of the section """"Shape of The Tower"""" in March of 2007, so I know that the orphaned sentences answer the question: What mathmatical calculation was Eiffel referring to? I tried to edit the article, but found it is now semi-protected owing to excessive vandalism. I propose that an autoconfirmed user revise the entire paragraph as follows:
In search of what mathmatical calculation Eiffel referred to, researchers have found that Eiffel used empirical and graphical methods accounting for the effects of wind rather than a specific mathmatical formula. Careful examination of the tower shows a basically exponential shape; actually two different exponentials, the lower section overdesigned to ensure resistance to wind forces. Several mathmatical explanations have been proposed over the years; the most recent is described as a nonlinear integral equation based on counterbalancing the wind pressure on any point on the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point. As a demonstration of the tower's effectiveness in wind resistance, it sways only 6–7 cm (2–3 in) in the wind.

Speedy deletion of Ozgur Cebir
 A tag has been placed on Ozgur Cebir requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Some editors put again and again the following passage in the section on the overview of the dispute:
 The Dalai Lama has “banned” the practice of Dorje Shugden and in so doing caused a rift in the Tibetan community as it is a widespread practice.[6] Tibetan and Western practitioners are currently organizing demonstrations against the Dalai Lama's ban wherever the Dalai Lama appears, accusing him of denying them religious freedom.[7] The representative of the Dalai Lama appeared in Hamilton New York to say that from a legal standpoint there is no ban. However, he was contradicted by the practical examples and stories of Dorje Shugden practitioners which clearly indicate that while legally there may be no ban, from the point of view of discrimination there is clearly a ban in effect and it arises from the Dalai Lama’s words. The representative said that he would look into all the evidences of human rights abuse within the Tibetan community in India and agreed that they were wrong.[8]

It's a continent made up of over 50 countries. Look at List of African countries. They're nationalities are in the demographics link. Nationality refers to your country, not continent, of birth.

And if the Game of Life has no players, is it really a game? Or is it an algorithm or mathematical """"thing""""? If you grow a flower or a crystal, its not a game. So when you grow the """"Game of Life"""", is it really a game?

 RE:RE: Blagojevich 

Copied from my talk page, no response required

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.  I promoted it to ITN on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is, IMO, notable whether the subject himself is or not (though I'd figure it is inherent).  Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase.

As to the portal, thanks for letting me know, I was not aware of the duplication being needed in the editing, I thought it was transcluded.  Learn something new every day ;)

And lastly, I still think that it should be on the main page.  While I can understand Spencer's logic in that it needs more information to make it encyclopedic and not just news, I personally don't think that anymore should or could be added to the article on the Blagojevich scandal at the time and it is a pretty descriptive article.  

No matter it all, thanks for the input and the learning opportunity from all three. talk """,0

 Good Faith, Bad Faith 

I assume good faith. It seems simply an act of confusion. 

Why would you assume good faith with this person, but not with me?   
You dismiss my perspective as """"nonsense and bullshit"""" and a cursory browsing of your Talk page reveals this is a somewhat common response, on your part, to DisagreementViolations of WP Tenants certainly as bad as those you cast at this newbie.

My initial comment that this is 'frivolous' was not meant to imply a bad faith MfD on your part (although I did consider it at first). The policy on userpages (nor much of anything on this site) is written in stoneI do not endorse your citation, nor do I agree with its application. I consider this a frivolous (and suprisingly devisive) issue. 

I wonder, regardless of where this vote goes, whether the world will be a better place afterwards. Obviously you think so, but from an airplane's perspective I see a tiny little person defending (like hell) everyone from a Username that hasn't offended anybody. """,1

Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency.  So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on """"A"""" and had almost nothing on """"B"""".  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.  

Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.  Of course, I am striving for NPOV.  Do you really feel that presenting Freud's pseudoscience without comment is NPOV, whereas quoting one of many eminent critics is not?   21:55, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)""",0

Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

988,"I am currently considering working on the following articles:
Microbial Genetics Stub
This is the stub that I added to with my first edit. I find this topic very interesting and think that it has made an immense contribution to the field of genetics. The study of genetic pathways in bacteria for example has led to the process of DNA cloning that is used in laboratories worldwide.  Viruses are also considered to be part of this category although some scientists argue they are not alive, they have also made contributions to molecular laboratory techniques (ex. using retroviruses to insert target DNA into a host cell genome).

Selaginella
I learned in second year genetics from David Smith that these plants have very interesting Post transcriptional RNA editing, where many of the cytosine nucleotides are changed to uracil nucleotides, resulting in an RNA transcript that looks quite different from its template DNA. I found this very interesting and would like to learn more about this topic and use that knowledge to expand the wiki page of Selaginella.

Ectopic Expression
Ectopic expression is the expression of a gene where it is not normally expressed. This is another stub on Wikipedia, and though this not a topic I am familiar about, I would like to learn more about it, its mechanisms, its applications and how it is expressed in human disease.",0

This entry's game-plot/storyline is longer than the combined entries for the plot/storylines of all three movies.  A few hundred fans of the game may care about its story, but this sort of overly detailed plot exposition doesn't belong in a Wikipedia article.  Smells like fans trying to save a dying game.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  
I agree, though before seeing this section I was going to suggest splitting it off into a separate article to satisfy those who disagree. I think we need a little more discussion and consensus before coming to a decision, however.  t 

Honestly I don't there is any need to """"satisfy"""" anyone who is not content with it.  The cruft is barely (if at all) notable enough to be in this article.  Never mind its own.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

I don't think obvious personal bias against this (or any game for that matter) should be a motivator for any article changes.    —Preceding comment was added at  

The obvious personal bias of a few overzealous gamers is the reason the article's so bloated with trivial data to begin with.  I'm with Ookami, this game just plain isn't notable enough to warrant a chapter by chapter breakdown of its storyline.  That's what fan sites are for.   

Just checked the World of Warcraft page out of curiosity, and even it doesn't have this much detailed story description.  In fact it barely has any, and I don't think anyone can argue which of the two games is more notable.  Also someone further up the page here brought this issue up already under 'generic story', why is this still being allowed?  

I play this game, I could care less that the huge exposition was taken out. That was an absolutely ridiculous story summary; most of the people that play the game couldn't tell you half of it. However, to kill the previous, argument, WoW barely has a story, while the Matrix Online's main content and selling point is the story. We don't need a 20 paragraph summary like before. A mention that there have been past live events, as well as a 4 sentence or so story summary, should suffice. I'd challenge one of you to do it, as I don't think any of you know anything about the game in the current state, besides that it is much weaker than World of Warcraft.   
To clarify my point above, I think the storyline section is very good now, it does, however, need the slightest mention of what has happened.   

Just for clarification, the game's main selling point was not the story itself, but that the players would be shaping the story, which never happened.  And WoW has plenty of story, enough to fill reams of Wikipages, it's just that it doesn't belong here in that great of detail.  This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, not a novel.  

Well, since there seems to be some rough consensus that this is well overdone, and that there has been no real objection to it, and pending the fact that no one with the adequate experience within the game has stepped forward to trim it down and keep whatever are the key points, I'm going to purge it.Talk|@ 
Per the anon-IP user's objection in the page history of the main article...  It doesn't matter.  Its that simple.

 stop stupid acusations 
I find it unacceptable to delete peoples contribution without any comments. I have now been repeated acused of writing a long rant while all my modifications thereof have been reverted. 

There is no OFFICIAL evidence incriminating Osama as the eavil doer. 
This reenforces why all acusations of muslim terrorist attack should have proper quotation.
If you lack such sources (which I claim you do) we do not need your opinion to provide the rest of reality.

Your lies as """"the truth"""" here in wikipedia
The suggestion there would be sufficient proof or even mainsteam consensus about the event is a clear lie. I personally find it unimaginable that wikipedia has a page where Muslim Extremists are claimed to be the cause leaving no room for any sensible explaination.

no referrences to  Obstruction of justice huh? 
The article should clearly mention the great effort the Bush administration made of hiding all the evidence. This was the main embodyment of the attack. Obstruction of justice of this scale is a far bigger crime as murder.

FOLLOW THE MONEY!
The page should mention Lary Silverstein owned the building for a day and a half and maxed out the insurance for multiple terrorist attacks. Thus he cashed in multiple times.

the muslim extreamist terrorists label kit

I was acting on the advice of the admin who blocked you. The responses have a great deal of value, particularly as they're from experienced editors, rather than SPAs with fewer than 500 edits.  (talk) (contributions) 
I agree with Carl and other users that it is important for material to be properly sourced and to avoid original research and synthesis. I was concerned with the first sentence in the section Spin added:
For centuries the common story of the birth of Jesus has been a product of the two birth narratives in Matthew and Luke, but it is not easy to understand the progress of the individual birth narrative in each gospel, because the content of the other narrative is already too well ingrained in our approach to the material, so, in order to clarify the relationship between them, the basic elements are compared in the following table.'
The assertion that """"it is not easy to understand the progress of the individual birth narrative in each gospel"""" is a matter of opinion and needs an in-line citation refering to a reliable source. Same thing for the assertion """"because the content of the other narrative is already too well ingrained in our approach to the material"""". According to whom? Once again, it needs to refer to a reliable source.
It may be more productive to show the suggested section and table on this talk page or on a sub-page and then have editors comment and work through differences before adding the material into the article. At present there's no consensus to add the material, which means that Spin puts something in and then another editor like Carl removes it. In situations like this it's best to slow down, follow 1RR, and work through issues through talk page conversations. Alternatively, third opinions or other dispute resolution mechanism may help. Cheers,  
For the moment I have removed the introductory comment and left the original statement. (I'll just remind you of all the Christmas creches which depict the shepherds and the magi together, all the paintings which do the same, the comments here of people who cannot accept the scholarly opinion that Matthew has Joseph living in Bethlehem only to move to Nazareth at the end of the narrative.) 
I don't understand how a person will work through issues when they have successfully erased the material. One needs to be constructive to make progress on Wiki, not destructive. It is the dialog which allows progress. If a person doesn't want to enter into a constructive dialog, then it doesn't matter how one proceeds. 
So, how about it, Carl Bunderson, can you be constructive on the issue?  control 
I have been constructive until I am blue in the face. You've no sense of how OR, RS, and primary sources all interact. A clear majority of persons have indicated that your edits are inappropriate, you merely obstinately refuse to acknowledge it. Talking to you does absolutely no good.  (talk) (contributions) 
You have not been at all constructive. You don't use the notion of primary sources as indicated in the material I've already quoted. All you've done is to opine that it is OR which it plainly isn't. You don't give constructive indications as to how to improve the material. Constructive indications involve proposing alternatives that would make the material acceptable to you. As to primary sources, again, this is what Wiki says:
Primary sources that have been reliably published (for example, by a university press or mainstream newspaper) may be used in Wikipedia, but only with care, because it is easy to misuse them. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation. Without a secondary source, a primary source may be used only to make descriptive claims, the accuracy of which is verifiable by a reasonable, educated person without specialist knowledge. For example, an article about a novel may cite passages from the novel to describe the plot, but any interpretation of those passages needs a secondary source.
I make no conclusions about the material. I don't make any interpretations of the material. You seem to me to simply be wrong in your interpretation of the rules.  control 22:""",0

You are welcome to improve the article to meet Wikipedia's quality standards and remove the deletion notice from the article. You may also remove the notice if you disagree with the deletion, though in such cases, further discussion may take place at Articles for deletion, and the article may still be deleted if there is a consensus to do so.

Wikipedia has certain standards for inclusion that all articles must meet. Certain types of article must establish the notability of their subject by asserting its importance or significance. Additionally, since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, content inappropriate for an encyclopedia, or content that would be more suited to somewhere else (such as a directory or social networking website) is not acceptable.

 Identity of the designer 

The paragraph just above the heading """"Origins of the term"""" states:

""""Intelligent design deliberately does not try to identify or name the specific agent of creation — it merely states that one (or more) must exist. Although intelligent design itself does not name the designer, the personal view of many proponents is that the designer is the Christian god.[34][22][35] Whether this was a genuine feature of the concept or just a posture taken to avoid alienating those who would separate religion from the teaching of science has been a matter of great debate between supporters and critics of intelligent design. The Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District court ruling held the latter to be the case.""""

The above statement contains a popular misconception about the identity of the designer. ID leaders have indeed named the designer. 

The article's reference #34 above is to Dembski's 1999 Touchstone article in which he says that """"intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory."""" When Dembski said that, he was identifying, indeed defining, the designer as not only God but Jesus Christ, to which """"Logos"""" refers in the Gospel of John, as Barbara Forrest points out on pp. 3-4 of her paper http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf.

See also the article's reference #142 at pp. 39-40 of """"Is It Science Yet? Intelligent Design Creationism and the Constitution,"""" at  http://law.wustl.edu/WULQ/83-1/p%201%20Brauer%20Forrest%20Gey%20book%20pages.pdf.  Note here also that Phillip Johnson also defines ID as requiring God when he defines it as """"theistic realism.""""

Midwest Accent
I see that you are deleting my corrections regarding the General American accent, in the article """"Midwest,"""" which quite wrongly implies that General American is owned lock stock and barrel by that region.

You are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the Midwest, before I'kk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. It certainly is not unique to the Midwest, a region which was not even settled by English speakers until barely 150 years ago, after the northern accent was known to exist in places like Pennsylvania and upstate NY, and Connecticut. It really bugs me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast. The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same. And we've been speaking this way since before the Midwest was even settled, so it's nonsense to say it's a Midwest accent.""",0

Fair enough...not going to worry too much about it, but it is rather bothersome.  Although, it is my understanding that since the article deals with a subject that is primarily of American interest, it is American English conventions that are to be used.  Certainly, when the subject is not of any specific interest to speakers of a particular form of English, then there's no reason to go about changing it; it should just be left as originally written, unless someone changes the substance of it and uses the form with which he is accustomed rather than what was originally written.  However, that is not the case here.

Furthermore, without context those examples you cited are useless.  Whether """"Indianapolis Colts"""" is a plural or singular noun depends on whether or not it's being used to refer to the entity itself as distinct from the individuals that make it up, or whether it's just being used to refer to the individuals collectivelly.

If this confirms that Ehud Lesar is not an Ehud Lesar, then any evidence provided to the arbitration in secret is not a confirmation. Because at this point, if it is true that Ehud is not claiming to be an Ehud Lesar anymore, if it is Adil he can ask anyone to provide identity to have him return, because he doesn’t need to prove he is Ehud Lesar. So this case should be taken to judge if there is sufficient evidence that Ehud is Adil or not.

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix.

It is so cute to see a severely retarded shut-in try out wikipedia and think that she can save it from the communists. Joe Wilson did something never before seen in a joint session of congress, he shit his pants, I mean he yelled at his superior in the military chain of command. You really have to be a low lying pussy to defend a white trash hick. There is a reason the democrats won the election for both congress and the white house, that is why fags like you are left in the dust grabbing on to hilarious conspiracies about the birth certificate and dipshit jesus's death panels.

Regarding HeartBreaker, The Original Tribute to Pat Benatar, please forgive me for not fully understanding what makes this listed for deletion. Perhaps it's just a guiedlines issue? But, what speciffically makes any of the other tribute bands listed on the tribute act page any more notable than HeartBreaker to allow those pages inclusion? Is it the formatting? Unfortunately, I am new to the Wikipedia environment regarding editing and possibly need some direction on this? I came across the tribute acts pages and noticed The Iron Maidens, which is a local group with not as long a tenure in the tribute community as HeartBreaker, although definately notable, and they are incuded. But beyond The Iron Maidens are bands whos accomplishments pale in comparison to HeartBreaker. HeartBreaker IS a notable, respected and an acknowledged band of the tribute community as well as being one of the first of local tribute acts to appear in the L.A. area when the tribute phenomenon began during the late 90s, particularily with a female lead singer. That, in itself makes HeartBreaker a pioneer to the community. What other information or details do you suggest including, other that what is listed in the biography which is certainly not insignificant, in order to make this page more or as """"notable"""" than or as any of the other other listed tribute bands by Wikipedia standards, and to gain inclusion? Please advise. I have perused some of the other acts' pages linked to the tribute acts page and see only a few with significant notability, most have even fewer accomplishments and notariety than HeartBreaker, some I've never even heard of and certainly aren't known to our local tribute community, which definately expands beyond just the L.A. area. HeartBreaker has been written about and featured in reliable sources and is known for it's tenure, quality and respected within our tribute community, particularily since we are one of the longest running tributes AND are acknowledged BY the artist to whom we pay tribute, Pat Benatar and members of her band(s). We are the only band of any kind listed in her official web pages and have been joined by significant original members of her band. This in itself lends support to the tribute act pages. The histoy of the tribute act pages specifically points to acts who are joined to play with the artists to whom they tribute and further goes on the list bands on the page. Why is it not acceptable to list HeartBreaker and a biography of information to support the tribute act pages? We may not have as much notariety as The Iron Maidens but we certainly are not insignificant and definately are more notable that some of the listed bands. HeartBreaker was featured in a televised documentary about tribute bands on a major network and has been written about and listed is major publications. How can any of this not be notable when this is in regard to tribute bands?????? Please explain. Thank you.""",0

Hey asshole.

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

I agree, a lot of the subsequent edits since my original ones are puffery, and look like they are by the same anonymous person. The article I wrote was fairly minimal in detail (see Robyn_E._Kenealy&oldid;=191510307), but my original edits were well sourced. I am particularly concerned that Cameron Scott does  not recognise New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz as an authoritative source because it is an open source wiki. This website is the authoritative resource for information about New Zealand comics. While individual contributors can add their information to this wiki, content is stringently moderated by Funtime Comics's sysops Darren Schroeder, Ruth Boyask and Isaac Freeman. The website has also won awards for its content. This is an important issue because if you set the precendent in this article of saying comics.org.nz website is not authoritative you are undermining comics culture in New Zealand.",0

 Dubious toe claim 

I've added the dubious tag to the toe claim because:

 Given Cartwright's paternalistic attitude it seems implausible he would prescribe it.
 Szasz is not unbiased; besides, almost everyone is somewhat biased against racists.  Szasz is, anyway, not a primary source.
 It seems like all sources regarding drapetomania are actually secondary to one paper published by Cartwright.

My guess is that toes of runaway slaves were amputated, perhaps as """"treatment"""" for drapetomania, but that Cartwright himself never prescribed this.  Anyway, perhaps I will check local libraries for the Szasz book, and try to find his source.  No promises though. – """,0

So I just removed a huge Mate1 ad from the article, because in my opinion (although I believe it was added in good faith by User:KRW), it's inappropriate for an article about a general product or service to feature prominently the advertising or image of one single product within the class. Some examples I looked at included:
 Soft Drink where the main picture shows a variety of brands on a supermarket shelf (with a photo of the Diet Pepsi product line much lower down)
 Potato chip where two of the three pictures are of chips without packaging, and the third is a non-current ad
 Fast food where all of the food is shown unwrapped (and only the Big Mac is clearly identifiable), plus a nondescript interior photo and a photo of several adjacent restaurants
 Chocolate bar with an unwrapped chocolate bar shown.

I agree with the above summary.
In my view, this is a textbook example of when not to force the article's title into the lead.  """"2011 Tucson shooting"""" isn't a widely accepted name for the incident.

1990,"student uprising 1973 

I don't have any research data exactly, but I am an American who was a US Navy dependent wife living in Athens when the Polytechnic uprising occurred. And since I was there, although not directly involved in the uprising (just got caught in some of the crossfire) my perspective is quite different from what has been presented on the pages.  I would like to share with you what my experience was, and perhaps it could lead to some further illumination of what really happened during that month or 2. (It wasn't all over in 2-3 days, as the story indicates) And there were many more killed than the numbers listed, although I have no evidence of this. I personally saw beatings and shooting by police and army at the Polytechnic when I took a friend to deliver food to her brother who was a participant in the uprising. Her name was Litha and his was Vagellis. I no longer recall last names, but could probably find out from some old friends. She came to New York to attend college in the mid to late 1970s.

The question that has always haunted me is why the US government totally ignored the entire situation in spite of the fact that the 6th fleet was anchored at Elyfsis and the AirForce base was fully manned and operational. The American press did not even report the uprising. As I was only 21 at the time, my parents watched carefully for some news of what I had written to them once mail service was restored, and only a short virtually nondescript article from UPS showed up buried in the back pages of the newspapers. It was never even mentioned on television here.

I am still haunted by what I saw, and that was 32 years ago. I chose your user name from the discussion page because of the passion you wrote with in the wording of several of the sections (although they were changed from your original wording).  From this I came to think that you must believe somewhat strongly in presenting the material accurately and as completely as possible.

it is inarguable you're trying to improve the exposure lesser-known bands, whose musical merits are FAR inferior to Elton John's. That is not how music works. I have never ever seen someone post cover art of covering artists' album. it is unheard of and rude. it is the only page for which i have ever seen this, and clearly it is your prerogative to promote Ben Folds and other horrible bands.
The bottom line is that Elton John is a LEGEND, and I think what you're doing is no different than someone posting cover art for a boyband cover of a Beatles song; you would be eviscerated if you did something like that for a Beatles single, and I don't see why such evisceration should be spared when you're insulting arguably one of the best musicians in the past 50 years. Do not argue about whether this is an encyclopedia, argue the merit for why the cover art of inferior artists whose musical merit is far far far below that of the ORIGINAL artist. You can't, because you know they are inferior. instead you're using a BS """"freedom of information"""" argument to ruin the appeal of a great song. No one covers a song better than the original artist. For example: Oasis' cover of Street Fighting Man is unbelievable, but I would NEVER EVER go to the Rolling Stones' """"Street Fighting Man"""" single page and post Oasis' cover art, even though their merit is much closer to the Stones than Ben Folds is to Elton John.

The information in this page, and in house of names, is not full, nor is it accurate...

All Bélanger and Belanger family have three Origins, these origins are;

 1 = France
 2 = Germany
 3 = England

 My name Is Martin Charles François Bélanger... Family Archive bearer... 

I am a direct descendant of the Bélanger Family knights that came to Canada From the family castle in France. The """" Chevaliers De Belle Angers """" I.E. (knights of beautiful angels), from the """"Chateau D'Anger"""" next to the town of """"Anger"""" in Normandie of France. Our Ancestors are recorded to have been """"Gaulois"""" since 300 years before Christ... meaning Gaelic... and YES, Gaelic France is the same as in England... and it is the origin language of French... (RECORDED FACT OF HISTORY).

 The Familly from Germany that is related to the Belanger Family and not Bélanger

family, was actually the ancient family of Ingers. This Family also had many dealings, commerce and mixing of families between the Bélanger and Belanger family. This produces Belle Ingers... Belingers, Berengers, and more... Ingers also had a great meaning to the name and you may want to look it up. (Proven to be found in the original family archives.)

 The Bélanger Family also went to Nottingham England in the service of the King to help in the holly Crusades. The name then was pronounced Belanger, and made quite the mix in the family tree. (Found in the original family archives.)

  There is quite the extensive research done in exactly what happened in our family.  For more information on the real origins of the real Bélanger Family... Look for...

The """" Chateau d'Anger """" in Normandie, France... and look into the

Family of """" Ingers """" in Germany. Both families pre-date the roman invasion of Europe.

Wrong licenses
I have corrected the licenses for the majority of the images you have uploaded. The exceptions are:
:Image:Wankhede Mumbai.jpg - On the flickr page the author has apparently agreed to license the image under one of the free Creative Commons licenses, but failed to actually change the licensing. 
:Image:Dhoom2.jpg - Concern that the creator is in no position to submit the image under a Creative Commons license, as it depicts a billboard for a film and copyright to it is held by somebody else than the photographer. As such, the photo may not be used on Wikipedia, except perhaps under fair use policy (which probably doesn't apply), or under panorama freedom (depending on what the copyright law of India says on this topic).
:Image:Bipasha.jpg - Image description page implies that it is licensed for non-commercial use only (contradicting your copyright tag); such a restriction is not acceptable on Wikipedia. In addition, the link to the original source (which could clarify which condition is correct) of the image is missing.
:Image:Bom.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""". 
:Image:Chowpatti.jpg - To verify that the image is indeed under the license you claim, the author should probably e-mail the Wikimedia Foundation and confirm that it is indeed under that license.
:Image:Hydmall.jpg - The flickr page states that it is under a Creative Commons No-Derivative license; a license that prohibits the image to be modified/used in derivative works is not acceptable on Wikipedia, either.
:Image:Infobangalore.jpg - No evidence of the image being under a free license.
:Image:Brigaderoad.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Hoogly.jpg - The link to the original source at flickr is missing; author uploads images to flickr as """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Haf.jpg - Flickr page states """"all rights reserved"""".
:Image:Bangtemp.jpg - Creative Commons No-Derivative license.
:Image:Kolkahomes.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Delhimall.jpg - Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No-derivative license (unacceptable on Wikipedia).
:Image:Yamun.jpg - All rights reserved.

:Image:Myspalbang.jpg - All rights reserved.
:Image:Bangalore.jpg - The link to the original source is missing; no evidence that it is under the Creative Commons license.
:Image:Lalbagh.jpg - Taken from WikiTravel. Uploader ought to confirm that he is indeed under the author and that he has licensed it under the license indicated.
:Image:Nagpur.JPG - Who made this image?

There are several issues here. There are multiple Creative Commons licenses, not all of which are acceptable on Wikipedia. In particular, licenses that prohibit commercial use or making of derivative works are considered unfree and can't be used on Wikipedia, except as provided by the fair use policy; Creative Commons Atrribution, and Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike licenses are okay. Also, there are multiple versions of the licenses; Creative Commons Atrribution Sharealike 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 are all distinct licenses. (The problem is that the upload dialogue only lists the 3.0 versions and not the earlier ones; when the image is under one of the older licenses, you ought to edit the image description page and correct the number. As far as I can see, Flickr only uses the 2.0 versions of the licenses.)

In addition, some of the Flickr authors have indicated that they allow the image to be used on Wikipedia, without making it clear that they release it under one of the acceptable licenses; a permission that only extends to Wikipedia is not sufficient, either. You should ask the authors to do one of the following:
Change the Flickr page to license the image under Creative Commons Attribution (or Attribution Sharealike) license (apparently, this would change the licensing for all images, and this may not be what they intend to do);
Post a message to the image page with a text similar to the following:
I, creator of the image, agree to license it under the Creative Commons Attribution license (link) [alternately: under the Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike license (link). This declaration overrides any statement to the contrary on this page.
E-mail the Wikimedia Foundation (permissions-en[AT]wikimedia[DOT]org) with a message similar to the above, also specifying which image (images) the user intends to release under the license. (This would be the best choice if the author doesn't want to reveal his identity on Wikip",0

It seems to me, to use a Christian metaphor, that you cast the first stone.  Basically my attitude here is that it is not only good men who should be identified as Christians.  If someone self-identifies as a train enthusiast that is good enough for me.  If there is a Wikipedia category for train enthusiasts then he should be included.  The category is for """"train enthusiasts"""" not """"good train enthusiasts"""".  We have no need to examine the purity of his enthusiasm.   

Besides, you are on a slippery slope.  In one Western democracy yesterday it was announced that more than 180,000 abortions happened last year.  That country is run by one who identifies himself very publicly as a Christian.  But he never speaks out against abortion.  He also took his country to war on false pretenses (he deliberately told lies) and in that war 20,000 innocent civilians have died who would not have died if there had been no war.  Using your argument Tony Blair cannot be identified as a Christian.   

But I do not want to use your argument.  Nor do I think we should.  (But even if we use your argument we cannot see into Tariq Aziz's soul.)  That you (presumably another Christian) re-act with distaste that Aziz belongs to the same club is not the point.

Slpl1, Please!! The situation is NOT """"an exact parallel"""" to the examples you've given, especially the first. In that example you're comparing a matter of hard science to a highly subjective jouranistic description. Basketballs to oranges. We don't have a choice as to what causes AIDS. We can't say, for example, that it is caused by a severe deficiency of Vitamin C because that would simply be false. But in the case of the men's rights movement there are all sorts of descriptions, ones used by """"scholars"""" no less, that would not be false. We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn't say """"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus"""" would we? Rather, we would say that """"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus"""" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, """"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus."""" That's because """"is considered to be"""" also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.

Your second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn't all that obviously unacceptable to me. However, in the case of Holocaust denial we are almost invariably dealing with clear-cut antisemitism and scholars and editors should call a spade a spade. In the case of the MRM, I think that both scholarly and popular literature will reflect that we are not dealing with the same degree of monolithic hatred. Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don't reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.

What I see in the present """"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement"""" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could """"get away with""""  (saving the even less acceptable """"misogynist"""" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could """"get away with"""": """"It is considered to be"""".

 Thanks to both of you. I think that the average number of national newspapers per nation (781) is way too high. Even if we include the nations not recognised by the UN, I don't think it would decrease to a more realistic figure. For example, how many national newspapers does Great Britain have? I don't think it even comes close to a hundred. On the other hand maybe, as Bus stop said, each of the ten days is counted as a new occurrence. At least this would reduce the number by an order of magnitude.  λogosπraxis """,0

1 See, any hope [of capturing] him must be disappointed; One is prostrated by the very sight of him. 

2 There is no one so fierce as to rouse him; Who then can stand up to Me? 

3 Whoever confronts Me I will requite, For everything under the heavens is Mine. 
4 I will not be silent concerning him Or the praise of his martial exploits -Meaning in Hebrew Uncertain- 

5 Who can uncover his outer garment? Who can penetrate the folds of his Jowls? 

6 Who can pry open the doors of his face? His bared teeth strike terror. 

7 His protective scales are his pride, Locked with a binding seal. 

8 One scale touches the other; Not even a breath can enter between them. 

9 Each clings to each; They are interlocked so they cannot be parted. 

10 His sneezings flash lightning, and his eyes are like the glimmerings of dawn. 

11 Firebrands stream from his mouth; Fiery sparks escape. 

12 Out of his nostrils come smoke As from a steaming, boiling cauldron. 

13 His breath ignites coals; Flames blaze from his mouth. 

14 Strength resides in his neck; Power leaps before him. 

15 The layers of his flesh stick together; He is as though cast hard; he does not totter. 

16 His heart is cast hard as a stone, Hard as the nether millstone. 

17 Divine beings are in dread as he rears up; As he crashes down, they cringe. 

18 No sword that overtakes him can prevail, Nor spear, nor missile, nor lance. 

19 He regards iron as straw, Bronze, as rotted wood. 

20 No arrow can put him to flight; Slingstones turn into stubble for him. 

21 Clubs are regarded as stubble; He scoffs at the quivering javelin 

22 His underpart is jagged shards; It spreads a threshing-sledge on the mud. 

23 He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; He makes the sea boil like an ointment-pot. 

24 His wake is a luminous path; He makes the deep seem white-haired. 

25 There is no one on land who can dominate him, Made as he is without fear. 

26 He sees all that is haughty; He is king over all proud beasts.

Fair use rationale for Image:Leonidas_01.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Leonidas_01.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

I read the comment differently that you, apparently (and that's """"read"""" in the present tense).  Also, as someone who is part of the LGBT community and has been intimately aware of AIDS and those with it since the early-80s, I can tell you that """"resentment"""" isn't really accurate.  Look, I've known more than 100 friends who have died from the disease - at least 2/3 of them dying in the 1980s; the remainder in the early to mid-1990s before the drugs got better and more effective over the long-term.  There was a time when I was attending multiple funerals every month.  I still know a good number of men who remain HIV positive but have somehow stayed alive with the disease for more than two decades.  I can testify as a first hand-witness that it wasn't """"resentment"""" people in the gay community were feeling, it was anger.  And certainly not because of Ryan White's openness of what it was like for someone outside the gay community to contract the disease.  The anger was directed largely at the US government as well as those who insisted that those who did get sick and die, died because of who they were and were being punished.  Ryan White and Elizabeth Glaser put a new face to AIDS, most certainly, but I know of *no one* in the gay community (and as someone who is actually a part of the gay community, I think I would have a better perspective than someone who isn't no matter how close they think they are/were to those in the queer world) who felt """"resentment"""" over the attention AIDS received after their AIDS diagnoses became public knowledge.  If anything, the gay community and those with HIV/AIDS within the gay community were elated that something was now going to be done, while skeptical it might be short-lived and/or selective, yet still quite angry that when it was a """"gay disease"""", it wasn't important enough for the POTUS to acknowledge.

REVISED UPDATE: As far as I can tell, """"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau"""" does not now appear on any list of anthems, national or otherwise. The links given above take you to List of anthems of UN member states, which has no mention of it, or National anthem, which has this little gem:
===For parts of states===
The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, amongst others, are notionally held to be unions of many """"nations"""" by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" and these songs may be officially recognized.
14 of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union had their own official song which was used at events connected to that republic. The Russian republic used the USSR's national anthem. Some republics retained the melodies of those songs after the dissolution of the USSR (see the article National anthems of the Soviet Union and Union Republics).
The United Kingdom's national anthem is """"God Save the Queen"""" but its constituent countries also have their own anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a number of songs which may be played at occasions such as sports matches and official events. The song usually played for England is """"God Save the Queen"""", though sometimes Jerusalem and Land of Hope and Glory may be played instead. Scotland has relatively recently adopted Flower of Scotland as its unofficial National Anthem, while Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century. Northern Ireland too has traditionally used """"God Save the Queen"""" though Londonderry Air is also used.
""""Wales has sung Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land Of My Fathers) since the 19th century"""", which is pretty good going - was it non-stop? No mention of the term """"national anthem"""" and the wording of the intro - notionally held to be unions of many """"nations"""" by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own """"national anthem"""" - plus the section heading """"parts of states"""" - clearly downgrades the status of Wales (and others). But my main concern is that our national anthem gets no recognition on a list, unless I've missed it; nothing showed on 'what links here'.   22:55, 4 September 2009""",0

I wish I could find better sites to post, but those two are the only ones I've been able to locate. I did not mean to post a commercial site, and did not think I was posting a commercial site, since none of the sites I posted actually sold any poppers.

Inquirer.net is a reliable resource but the particular Inquirer.net article that you used as reference never mentioned that the Ang Dating Doon segment is a parody of Ang Dating Daan. In fact, the name of the program Ang Dating Daan cannot be found anywhere on that Inquirer.net article. Therefore, it does not qualify as reference, not because Inquirer.net is not reliable, but because the idea that you're trying to convey is not supported by the article. Dar book, it is actually you who is bellittling Philippine-related articles by your reckless and uneducated editing. If you truly value Philippine-related articles then you should be extra careful not to destroy their quality and credibility. Also, since you are editing the Tagalog Wikipedia, may I suggest that you begin creating a Tagalog version of the English WP articles on Eli soriano and Ang Dating Daan? If you don't do it, someone else is going to do it sooner or later. The information on the different language versions of WP must match (or at least approximate) the best and most comprehensive article, which in the case of Eli Soriano and Ang Dating Daan happens to be the English version. –   20:23",0

 Use as a mascot/nickname? 

The use of the binturong as a mascot and/or nickname for schools and sports teams is relatively dubious. All the schools listed in that section as using the binturong as a mascot actually only use the name """"Bearcats"""", or in one instance """"Bearkats"""". None of the logos used that show a full animal representing the bearcat resemble a binturong.

1312,"""   Regarding the """"Speedy Deletion"""" of my entry for The Resonance Project

I am unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper """"talk"""" process.  

I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's """"flat-earth society"""" type behaviour that I find objectionable.

I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called """"community"""".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the """"Speedy Deletion"""" I could find no such option.

When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.  Wikipedia you have a problem, and if I can't get entries for """"Nassim Haramein"""" and """"The Resonance Project"""" in I am going to begin a campaign to discredit and inform of the corruption of Wikipedia, the not-so-""""free"""" encyclopedia. Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.

This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.

If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?

Pasquier is merely mentioned as the governor of Cochinchina at the time, and even Aubert modestly assigns the authorship to his staff officers.  During the past seven years I have made a close study of both Histoire militaire and Conquête de l'Indochine, and there are so many verbal similarities that I am convinced that Thomazi (doubtless on Aubert's état-major) was the main author of Histoire militaire, even though he is not formally credited with it.  However, I have perhaps gone too far in formally attributing authorship to him.  Is it normally attributed to Aubert and Pasquier?  If so, I suppose I had better follow convention.",0

 Censorship 

Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all? I mean, the content wasn't as strong as, say, Final Fantasy VIII's, but I would imagine something was censored. Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this? 
Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.  
As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.  
The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.  
< recet indent
Some words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary.
Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored:
Computer: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
Cid: What!? Who is the little fuck!?
Computer: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there?
Earliest instance of """"Shit""""
Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either!
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*!
Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?
Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…
In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.  
My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored. 
 Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er 
Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue.. 
Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.   
Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time. 
It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.  

I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.

Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence.)

Mentioning Midgar's future
During the epilogue that follows, the ruins of Midgar are shown five hundred years later. While the landscape had once been desolate due to Shinra's operations, it is now a land of lush greenery.

This sentence should be removed as it is trivial, unnecessary, and uhhh too minor for mention, and there is no explanation for this scene.  NEWL",1

3747,"'s vandalism/lies/distortion of facts/mis-use of lack of communication between wiki administrators/WP:POV pushing 

I am putting it here, kindly read the whole story alongwith the proofs.

It appears that Admin User:Abecedare has ended up doing some big injustice without checking the facts. Per he has blocked anon User: 32.177.111.155 simply because he was trying to protect Wikipedia. Please correct this error otherwise this injustice and blocking comments are going to harm both innocent editors ( User: 32.177.111.155 and User: 209.183.55.115  ) and their zeal to work on wikipedia and their future contributions/history as well.

Why User Talk: 32.177.111.155's Block was unjustified

User Talk: 32.177.111.155’s edits do not constitute vandalism

He simply restored duly referenced text. 
 Proof 1
 Proof 2
 Proof 3

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 did not violate WP:3rr 

He did not violate WP:3RR and he simply quit editing.

 User Talk: 32.177.111.155 can not be a called a sockpuppet

 It was mentioned that User: 209.183.55.115 is licensed to Concord, CA and User: 32.177.111.155 is licensed to Los Angeles. Both of these cities are 6-7 hours of drive from each other? And it usually takes 1.5 hours of flight time if you want to fly from one city to another. 
  against violation of Wikipedia policies. Is simple warning constitute sockpuppetry?
If  had owned 2nd IP 209.183.55.115 as well, then he could have participated in the edit war through 2nd IP while staying within WP:3RR. It means he was not related to the 2nd IP at all.

Why ’s edits constitute violation of Wikipedia policies

Editor  repeatedly deleted duly referenced tex

Edit 1 
edit 2 
Edit 3 

Editor  repeatedly lied

 lied/mislead Wikipedia community through his edit summaries and statements.
Edit 1 – edit summary “Google Books isn't a very reliable source. Find a better source than that..”
edit 2 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
Edit 3 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer”
again lied that city of Concord and city of Los Angeles are next to each other to get the opposing editors blocked under sock category.

Editor  repeatedly violated WP:POV 

User:Neutralhomer ruthlessly suppressed others voice and kept on removing the referenced text by blatantly refusing to accept the wp:rs reliability of various internationally known newspapers and a very notable google book which is already part of wikipedia, i.e. Reduced to Ashes (book). User:Neutralhomer refused to accept following references only because he could not like them:

2858,"""The Starting Point is near Thebes ==

In Exodus Ramesses was one of a pair of treasure cities or emporia and the first station of the Exodus. In the story there are two treasure cities; Pithom in the Delta and Ra mes ses at Thebes, Egypt.

Exodus 1:7-14  And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Ramesses. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. 

If Ancient Egypt isn't something you have studied intensively there may be some confusion about what is a treasure city. A treasure city or emporia is a port where foreign traders can bring their goods through customs. 

In the 19th century archaeologists made speculations about San el-Hagar or Pi-Ramesses and Tell el-maskhuta or Pi-Athom  being the places mentioned in the story of the Exodus. These have since been corrected by trained Egyptologists, but the myths have lived on among """"biblical archaeologists"""" and laypeople. 

See: Baines and Malek,1987, Atlas of Ancient Egypt, Equinox, ISBN 0-87196-334-5 Pi-Riamsese 166,175,177, removal of capital to, 46, 84, 166.

Under San el-Hagar
...the temple is a mass of inscribed and decorated blocks, columns, obelisks and statues of various dates, some of them even bearing the names of rulers of the old and middle kingdoms (Khufu, Khepren, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II, Senwosret I), However the majority of the inscribed monuments are connected with Ramesses II and this led P. Monet, the greatest expert on the Tanis monuments  to believe this was the site of the ancient Pi-Ramesses, the delta capital of the Ramesids. Nevertheless none of the buildings so far excavated can be shown to have been built before the reign of Pausanes I of the Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt and the inescapable conclusion therefore is that all the ramessid and earlier monuments must have been brought from other places.

Under Tell el-maskhuta
In 1883 E. Neville excavated a large brick built enclosure (some 210 x 210 m) with a badly damaged temple at Tell el-maskhuta, in wadi tumilat. (In the late period a canal through this wadi enabled  ships to sail from the Nile into the Red Sea) Most scholars, though not all, identify Tell el-maskhuta with ancient Egyptian Tjeku and Pithom, (probably from per-Atum, The """"Domain of Athom"""") of the Exodus and the capital of the Eighth Lower Egyptian nome.

Pithom is an ancient city in Egypts delta. Its mentioned in Exodus as a treasure city in the same breath as Ramesses. You would have to know that from the Hyksos period onward there are emporia in both the delta and Thebes. In the delta cities like Sais served as """"Treasure cities"""" business or banking centers. At Thebes Elim on the Red Sea also served as a business or banking centers for the Red Sea trade in Frankincense, Myhr, Bitumen and perfumes and ointments such as ben jamin or juniper oil used at Karnak's mortuary temples.

Pithom and Rameses are located at opposite ends of the kingdom. Pi-Athom is an ancient nome capital (see below) in the delta. 

Ra mes ses means literally (Ra=sun), (mes=birth), (ses= to guard or observe), the place of observing the birth of the sun, the dawn in the east. During the entire history of Egypt the Red Sea was an important source of the materials used in the mortuary at Karnak. Karnak was where Moses would have gone to get the bones of Joseph

Exodus 13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. 

Following the stations list, the Exodus crosses the Red Sea between Elim and Elat. Elim, the sixth station, is Thebes Red Sea port.",0

SlimVirgin did raise the issue of tautology and I addressed it by saying that we need to write about welfare in the context of non-human animals.  You seem to think this is an impossible task, since we are human.  I reject this idea.  We can write about many non-human things.  Obviously, our ability to know about the welfare of a dog (for example) is limited by the fact that we are not dogs, but that does not change what animal welfare is.

Zoe, thank you for the kindness of your reply. I can't help wondering if your answer is to the point, however, since my question was about the use of  in articles and the reference you cite is about the talk pages. Moreover, it seems not to discuss comments. DreamGuy cites the use of comments in Wica (see his edit summary). I might add Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. These examples suggest to me that some use of comments may be appropriate in articles. The Katrina article was edited frequently by many distinct editors. I don't think comments would have been retained without support for their use. 
I wonder if you might be willing to reply to my query regarding the comment wording (and caps use) that I proposed in my previous message?
May I say that I don't agree with the reversion by DreamGuy of your deletion of my comments? My preference is to resolve this matter through discussion and dialogue. Best wishes,  (talk) 
 (... two editors want them here, one does not, so far that means the two editors win.... these guidelines are useful and used elsewhere, so no reason to remove them) copied from editorial summary DreamGuy (Talk) 
As a gesture of good faith, I'm going to put the wording I proposed above into the article in place of my original wording. I think my original might be considered shouting because of use of caps. Zoe and DreamGuy, please show restraint and don't revert my wording for now. Once we've agreed on a final version, one of us can edit the article to suit. Zoe, is there an editor whose judgement you trust that might be willing to take a look at this dispute and comment? Thank you both,  (talk) 

 In fiction and In music consensus 

The consensus (painfully) reached here is that the In fiction and In music sections should contain short representative lists of the most notable instances of chimera in fiction and music (see the article edit history and the arbitration on the article discussion page). These sections should not include every instance since the lists would become so long as to have little or no value and would give the impression that such uses are more important than mythical or scientific uses. Wikipedea is not mere collections of internal links. See what not to put on disambiguation pages, as well.

Consequently, before adding to this section, please take the following steps:
be sure that the article that you are linking mentions chimera. We should not be sending readers that are looking for information about chimera to articles that do not mention the term. 
verify that your addition is at least as notable as the examples already listed and that chimera plays a major, not just a tangential role in the work. 
consider replacing an existing less-notable entry. 
justify your edit on this page.

Finally, if you disagree with my opinion of the consensus, leave your comments here. Please don't edit the article to make your point.  (talk) 

Page move request
To move the page to its classical Latin spelling Chimaera. It is of course a classical creature / concept, which has nothing to do with the US, so why should it be at a recent US variant spelling? -  
I think this is a reasonable argument. On the other hand, the majority modern usage is with the Chimera spelling, I think.  Google finds 3,230,000 (Chimera) v. 1,010,000 (Chimaera). If Google is an indication of use frequency among Internet users, a majority of readers will be searching for Chimera. That is a weak argument; redirects are relatively cheap, or so I think.  (talk) 
Gee, why should it use a recent US spelling? Well, there's Wikipedia:Use English policy, Wikipedia:Naming conventions policy that say we use the most common version, and a conspicuous lack of any policy that says Wikipedia:Use archaic Latin. We spell it the way it's spelled in the real world, it's a little thing called Wikipedia:Use common sense.

There is no record of a criminal charge on my record of the so called soliciting a prostitute charge, thus it is not right to say so. I ask anyone to prove my criminal record includes such a charge. Furtermore while it is wholly true I have emailed the CPC and former YCl members, but not for some time and it is not a regular hobby. As a former communist I am concerned about any attempt to re-build that movement. Furthermore I am not a member of the pro-life board anymore and have not worked for Campaign Life since 2001. I still hold my persoanl views on the matter of abortion, and that is my right.
It has been stated in the press that the homosexual man beaten in that park was in fact participating in questionable behaviour in that park that media admits is frequented by gays. I in no way agree with the assualt what so ever and have never said such! Finally this question about pictures. The Manning picture was taken during a federal election and that is all. I do not force my self on political leaders and the picture was voluntary on Mannings part. Please prove otherwise.

Hi again, and well done for registering. 

Regarding the link that you were/are wanting to add to the Correlation and dependence article, I suggest the following... (i) you could best make your points for inclusion on the article's talk/discussion page, so that others can comment ... the edit summary and user's talk pages are not good for this; (ii) you could try to find a place in the article to make some kind of helpful reference to this link's content (that is, an inline citation rather than it just appearing in a bald way under """"External links""""), so that readers would know that the link is meant to be useful regarding """"interpretation""""; (iii) if you feel that this link does have something particularly useful to say, or a good way of looking at things, then you could try to summarise/ re-state these points within the article itself  ...again you could ask for opinions/help on the article's talk page, but there is really no reason why you shouldn't go ahead and add something. My own opinion is that adding plain """"external links"""" should be avoided once an article has substantial content. A previous editor mentioned """"linkspam"""" and, while this link might not quite fit within that term, the website itself didn't seem to have a lot of other content (but I could be wrong) and the """"substantiality"""" of the source has some bearing on whether a link is appropriate.

If you have an inclination to help in improving the content of the statistics articles more generally you should see Wikipedia:WikiProject Statistics. There is certainly need for help in improving the """"understandability"""" of all of the statistics articles, so don't be put off if there seems to be an emphasis on mathematical technicalities.

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned down or destroyed. Furthermore, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region who took refuge in the Republic of Albania.

Also, reviewing this, it seems that his Titstare comments were a trigger for his firing but not the real reason or cause, they just set some things in motion that led to people reviewing his Twitter feed. In that sense, I do think it is of due weight with respect to this controversy because it is perhaps part of the aftermath. As it stands, I think that reporting his Titstare comments and people's reaction to them, without mentioning that he was subsequently fired over a history of Twitter comments that were perceived as sexist, etc. (but that he defended as satirical) would be missing the bigger picture. Although I think we have enough sourcing to include his firing and the surrounding controversy, I think that if we decide that it's too irrelevant or too much of a BLP problem to include here, we should take most or all mention of him out rather than giving readers only part of the story. -",0

 Three phases of post-WWII relationships between Romania and the Soviet Union 

OK, I've done some research and I'm sure I still don't know as much as the rest of you but at least I am not as much of an ignoramus as I was a few hours ago.

I've looked at a number of online resources, most of them non-scholarly, but I think it's enough to get a feel for what the situation is.  The source that I found most useful is: this one.

It's clear that there were at least three phases of relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union after WWII.  The first was """"legal occupation"""" between 1944 and 1946/47.  As Hamish and Prete say, """"The occcupation lasted legally from the signature of the armistice until February 1947, when peace treaties were signed in Paris...""""

The next phase of the relationship involves a nominally independent Romania that is """"closely aligned"""" with the Soviet Union and COMECON.  As for Soviet troops, Hamish and Prete say """"[after 1947], Soviet troops remained, but on a different legal basis, in Romania and Hungary.  The official reason was that (the Soviets) needed to control communications between the Soviet Union and Soviet occupation forces in Austria.  This reason disappeared with the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty in 1955.  Instead, Soviet forces remained as Allied troops, and their status was more precisely defined with the signature in 1958 of the Warsaw Pact.""""

Now, we know that the Soviet troops were pulled out of Romania in 1958 and that Ceausescu took Romania on a path that diverged from COMECON but still remained enough in Khruschev's good graces that Romania never suffered a military incursion as Hungary or Czechoslovakia did.

The point here is that there are at least three phases of relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union.  The relationship between 1944 and 1946/47 was clearly one of occupation.  After 1958, everyone agrees that there was no more occupation of Romania.  However, between 1946/47 and 1958, it's not clear what people call it.  As Hamish and Prete state, the """"legal occupation"""" ended.  As cited here and in Soviet occupation of Romania, some sources state that the """"Soviet occupation"""" ended in 1958.  Others call it a """"virtual occupation"""".  Why virtual?  Because it had all the earmarks of an occupation except that it wasn't officially one.  (And thus my argument that we shouldn't call it an occupation because it wasn't one.)

What's the solution?  Here's my proposal...

First, stop getting caught up in what the title of the article says.  Let the Soviet occupation of Romania article remain where it is.  Mention the entire period of 1944-1958 under this title (i.e. Soviet occupations) but make it clear that there were three phases of relationship and, as I described it, """"the period from 1946/47 to 1958 had many of the characteristics of an occupation but was not legally considered to be an occupation"""".  Also add that many historians follow the lead of the Romanian government in calling the entire period from 1944-1958 an occupation by the Soviet Union.  

However, also note that it is unclear whether this characterization is used by """"most historians"""", """"many historians"""" or """"some historians"""".  In Soviet occupation of Romania, the text says """"most Western historians"""" but the references simply provide a handful of sources that use the word """"occupation"""" to refer to the period 1944-1958.  As someone argued, this could be just cherry-picking.  To support the assertion that """"most Western historians consider the period 1944-1958 to be a Soviet occupation"""", you have to find a source that says exactly that i.e. the text has to say """"most Western historians blah, blah, blah"""".  Failing that, using the word """"most"""" is OR.  Much better to say """"many"""" or just """"some"""".

About Eddieebo's death threat to someone, I read that, you are one dumb cunt, seriously, you are fucking stupid. That was not a death threat, there are death threats and death threats, this is the former, where it says kill but everyone should know no-one is serious about it. Maybe wikipedia should wake up to themselves, unblock Eddieebo's account, he has made some useful contributions, sure he swears a lot while talking, but thats because people like you shit him up the wall to no end.

 In general, do not use px without very good reason

What that means is, the policy needs not to be unilaterally enforced at all costs. If, as in this instance, there is a need for a change in size, it is permissible. The policy further states:
Where px is used, the resulting image should be no more than 500 pixels tall and no more than 400 pixels wide, for comfortable display on the smallest devices in common use.

I have already (and repeatedly) demonstrated that upsizing to 250px is all that required. (I bet even 220px would work). That is well within the limits. The change to the picture itself is negligible, and therefore does not impact the article negatively in any way. It only servers to benefit the article by making the text within the caption more wieldy and easier to read. It also eliminates the impact of needlessly extending the picture frame all the way down to the refs.

 Rank Uiller article 

Hi Excirial.
First, I want to say thank you, for your time. And Happy New Year! I've made some changes on my article and I want to know if they meet the guidelines regarding Reliable Sources.
Kind regards, Zoe.
  

 Hello there Zoepe,

 I might be wrong, but at first glance it would appear that the references used are the names of several expositions that art was showcased on? I fear that this doesn't fall under reliable sourcing as these references cannot be looked up by anyone (While being also of temporal nature). Since the article is a so-called BLP page, a Biography of a Living Person the requirement for sources is several notches higher than it would be for other article's to be accepted.

 What you are looking for are sources such as newspapers that can confirm what is written in the article itself. There might also be coverage in other literature such as magazines that can qualify as reliable.  (Contact me,Contribs) """,0

Woaah. Now you are making stuff confusing. Please stick to en-wiki for en-wiki matters, it took me a while to figure out """"Sweden"""" meant """"Swedish Wikipedia"""". But well: what kind of document is it? From what office? If it's an official document, it's bound to be published somewhere. And, remember, that it's true doesn't mean it should be included - if there has been no news reports or anything about it, it's hardly notable enough for inclusion. Stating that """"Infon ska in, så enkelt är det"""" will ~hardly promote healthy discussion about it.  (Talk ° contribs) 

 defaultsort is your friend! 

Hello! I noticed your edit to Mikael Odenberg, so I thought I should drop by and tell you about the wonders of {{DEFAULTSORT}}.

A sortkey is an alternative term the article should be sorted by when listed in a category. For example to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category """"people"""" and have the article sorted by """"Einstein, Albert"""". You would type """"[[Category:People|Einstein, Albert]]"""". This kind of sortkey you successfully added to Mikael Odenberg in your edit.

But, I reverted most of your edit! Why? Because there is a feature called """"Default sort key"""", which changes the default sort key used by categories from the name of the article to the one specified with the magic word {{DEFAULTSORT}}. Instead of adding |Odenberg, Mikael you simply add  {{DEFAULTSORT:Odenberg, Mikael}} above the categories, which I had already done in this case.

Thank you for your otherwise very valuable contribution!  (Talk ° contribs) 

Ooh, neat. I didn't see that. Apparently, this is a new function in MediaWiki 1.10. That's really handy knowledge for the other Wikimedia projects that I'm involved in as well. Thanks for letting me know! — (talk, contribs) 

 Chemsitry Comments 
I have noticed that you seem to spend a lot of time commenting on chemistry articles, claiming that they need to be either put in context or wikified. I was wondering if you could put in context your own level of knowledge in chemistry, so that the articles can be reeditted to be applicable to your own level of knowledge. With the chemical reaction stubs, I have been assuming that people will generally be looking at them  if they have a basic level of chemical knowledge (i.e. one of about an A-Level student in England) and will not need a full explanation of why the reaction proceeds as it does. If this does not fulfil your ideals what else will I need to add, complete mechanisms with comments of facial and stereo selectivities and such. If so this is simply not possible as there will be a large amount of repeated information on Wikipedia. Please get back to me on this topic. - 

Hello! Eh. Lately I've indeed been editing chemistry articles; BUT only to remove improper categories (such as those you added to, well, a damn lot of articles). Using AutoWikiBrowser. On some, tags such as {{wikify}} have been posted, but not many. I may have edited one or two chemical reaction stubs, but I don't know which ones. Point out more specifically which articles you refer to and I'll see what I can do. Do note, however, that my knowledge of chemistry is extremely basic, and my contributions to chemistry articles have only been clean-up/maintenance work.  (Talk ° contribs) 

Its okay. I'm a qualified chemist, but you seem to be suggesting for example on the Bechamp Reaction that more detail is needed. To me it seems clear. Also on the category front, they were not incorrectly labelled. I have been putting them into the topmost category they can go into so as to create a list of all the chemists that appear on wikipedia. This is because it is otherwise hard to see who may or may not need to be added. I have been finding your editting very unhelpful in removing them from this category.

Thomas Nelson, Sr.

Does anyone know whether or not Mr. Thomas Nelson, Sr., age 111, currently residing in Texas, formerly of Louisiana, served in the military before, during or after World War I?  Can anyone provide any further biographical information on Mr. Nelson  where he was born, where he lives now, etc.?  Finally, can anyone post links to any articles about Mr. Nelson?  Any information would be appreciated.

Well, let's look at what Ancestry says:-
There are 13 Draft Cards for WWI for a Thomas Nelson, of Louisiana 6 of which fit into the age category. There are other bits & pieces of information that can then be found from there, providing that is the correct info. Have you got any more details - middle name, initial, date of birth etc. to help us so we can help you?

Why speculate?  It was never mentioned anywhere that he is a WWI veteran.  He runs a candy store.  However, Silas Simmons is a closer candidate, based on what he said about 'loading ammunition' during WWI (at the shipyards). 

Why speculate?  Because he's in the right age range, and if there's a chance he served we sould check it out.  What's this about him running a candy store?

Thomas Nelson spent most of his life running a candy store.  He doesn't strike me as someone who would have served.  He is African-American.  →  {yakłtalk} 

""""Doesn't strike you?""""  Keep in mind the draft was in full force at the time, it didn't matter what you did.   

I agree  that kind of speculation is bizarre.  If you had the opportunity to meet and talk with him, Robert, why didn't you just ask him if he'd served?  What is it about running a candy store that makes someone unlikely to be called up for the draft?  Does he have a draft card on file?

One would think that if he served, the news article would have mentioned it.  But I find your statements hypocritical vis-a-vis the Silas Simmons comment. 

Silas Simmons?

Who is Silas Simmons?

Silas Simmons was born Oct 14 1895, according to his WWI draft card:

Name: Silas Joseph Simmons 
City: Philadelphia  
County: Philadelphia  
State: Pennsylvania  
BirthPlace: Delaware  
Birth Date: 14 Oct 1895  
Race: African  
Roll: 1907647  
DraftBoard: 27  

→  {yakłtalk} 

http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/16/Neighborhoodtimes/A_senior_among_seniors.shtml

Note: During both World War I and World War II, he loaded live ammunition for U.S. troops onto ships bound for Europe.

He is not on the GRG list because the 1900 census lists him as born in '1897' (which would make him 'only' 108, instead of 110 as claimed).  However, it's possible the census in this case is incorrect.  In any case, he was still alive a month ago, has a WWI draft card, and participated in an activity which was directly related to the war effort.  Whether he is a 'veteran' or not, I don't know if he was drafted.  But considering some 'veterans' on the current list were little more than telephone operators and ROTC students, Silas's efforts were a tangible contribution to the war.  He was also a Negro league ballplayer.→  {yakłtalk} 

This is not a discussion of the relative merits of peoples' service.  It's merely a question of service.  A veteran is someone who served in the armed forces; it's irrelevant where he or she served and what exactly they did.  Do we know whether Mr. Simmons loaded ships as a civ",0

Female masturbation techniques are quite numerous and perhaps more varied than those of males. They are influenced by a number of factors and personal preferences. Techniques include stroking or rubbing of the vulva, especially the clitoris, with the middle, index and/or second fingers. Sometimes one or more fingers may be inserted into the vagina to repeatedly stroke the frontal wall of the vagina where the g-spot is located. (Studies done by Masters & Johnson, however, have shown that only about 10% of women actually have orgasms through vaginal stimulation alone.) [citation needed] Masturbation aids such as a vibrator, dildo or Ben Wa balls can also be used to stimulate the vagina and clitoris. Many women will caress the breasts or stimulate a nipple with the free hand. Anal stimulation is also enjoyed by some because of the thousands of sensitive nerve endings located there.
Lubrication is sometimes used during masturbation, especially when penetration is involved, but this is by no means universal and many women find their natural lubrication sufficient—some even produce more lubricant alone than with a partner, though the reasons for this seem to be primarily psychological.
Women may masturbate in the bathtub, shower and hot tub, sometimes including the use of warm running water to stimulate the clitoris. Common positions include lying on back or face down, sitting, squatting, or even standing. Lying face down, one may straddle a pillow, the corner or edge of the bed, a partner's leg or some scrunched-up clothing and """"hump"""" the vulva and clitoris against it. Standing up, the corner of an item of furniture, or even a washing machine, can be used to stimulate the clitoris through the labia and clothing.

A vibrating duck. By de-dramatising the nature of a vibrator, this kind of toy has gained wider acceptance.
Some reach orgasm merely by crossing their legs tightly and clenching the muscles in their legs, which creates pressure on the genitals. This can potentially be done in public without observers noticing. Some prefer to use only pressure, applied to the clitoris without direct contact, for example by pressing the palm or ball of the hand against underwear or other clothing.
A few women can orgasm spontaneously, after experiencing prior sexual arousal, due to intellectual stimulation alone, for instance listening to certain pieces of music. Often, these mental triggers have associations with previous instances of arousal and orgasm. Some women claim to be able to orgasm spontaneously by force of will alone, but that ability, if it exists at all, may not strictly qualify as masturbation as no physical stimulus is involved.
Those who have difficulty reaching orgasm through sexual intercourse may find it easier to achieve an orgasm through masturbation. Sometimes sex therapists will recommend that female patients take time to masturbate to orgasm, especially if they have not masturbated before """,0

OPPOSE For reasons outlined below I would rather have this article named """"Japanese saddle"""" than """"Kura (saddle) if it comes to that.
""""Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy."""" Wikipedia:Consensus 
""""Wikipedia has many rules. Instead of following every rule, it is acceptable to use common sense as you go about editing. Being too wrapped up in rules can cause loss of perspective, so there are times when it is better to ignore a rule. Even if a contribution """"violates"""" the precise wording of a rule, it might still be a good contribution. Similarly, just because something is not forbidden in a written document, or is even explicitly permitted, doesn't mean it's a good idea in the given situation. The principle of the rules is more important than the letter. Editors must use their best judgment. Why isn't """"use common sense"""" an official policy? It doesn't need to be; as a fundamental principle, it is above any policy.Wikipedia:What """"Ignore all rules"""" means
A little history on this article. Before creating this article I first uploaded images and created categories that relate to this article on Wiki commons under this category """"Category:Kura (Japanese saddle)"""" [Kura_(Japanese_saddle)], this was over one year ago. There has been no objections to the title on Wiki commons.  When I originally named this article I did read the article naming guidelines contained in Wikipedia:Article titles, here are a few quotes from the naming guidelines:(it is sometimes necessary to add distinguishing information, often in the form of a description in brackets after the name.), I did this,  (The choice of article titles should put the interests of readers before those of editors, and those of a general audience before those of specialists.) It seems to me that only a """"specialist"""" would understand what type of saddle a """"kura"""" was, so when I named this article I looked at the list of saddle articles which are now in the category """"Saddles by type"""" and here were saddle articles with titles such as English saddle, Western saddle and Australian Stock Saddle. Looking at these other saddle article titles I decided that Kura (Japanese saddle) would be the best title for this article as anyone who looked at the other articles on saddles could easily and instantly identify what type of saddle the article was about, if I had named the article Kura (saddle) it would not be a descriptive as the other saddle articles and someone with no knowledge of the subject would have to actually click on the title to see what a """"Kura"""" was, with the word """"Japanese"""" added a reader could instantly identify what type of saddle a """"Kura"""" was, much like a reader who saw Australian Stock Saddle, Western saddle or English saddle would have a good idea what that article was about.
I have seen """"precision"""" mentioned, I do not understand how having the title as Kura (Japanese saddle) compared to Kura (saddle) goes against any of the guidelines in the section labeled """"Precision and disambiguation"""", WP:PRECISION, if I had named the article """"Kura (the saddle of Japan) I would understand but how does Kura (Japanese saddle) go against any naming guidelines, how different is Kura (Japanese saddle) than Australian Stock Saddle? The only difference is some brackets. Here is a quote """"Precision – Titles usually use names and terms that are precise (see below), but only as precise as necessary to identify the topic of the article unambiguously."""" WP:NAMINGCRITERIA, the title """"Kura (saddle) not """"precise"""" as it does not actually identify what type of saddle this is to the """"general reader"""", I would rather have the article named """"Japanese saddle"""" than """"Kura (saddle) so that anyone will know instantly what type of saddle this article is about if it is necessary to change the articles title, at least the """"general reader"""" would be able to know what the article is about without having to click on the title as they would with Kura (saddle).

 Does the rubberband AI section have anything to do with AI? 

The rubberband AI section section describes a situation where a computer controlled character get a bonus when losing. However in most of the examples in this section, the bonus is not related to AI, because the bonus does not make the computer controlled character smarter og it doesn't give the  computer controlled character any new information. As an example the section mentions a game where a computer controlled racing car gets a speed bonus.

 Romeo and Juliet comparison 

This is the quote I found from the source given (the other source seems to be a dead link):
""""""""Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative, but it's Shakespearean,"""" said Borden, who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet. """"We took from the best.""""""""

I see this has been discussed before and there doesn't seem to be a conclusion, so let me give my two cents. The story of a boy and a girl falling in love with each other but not getting their way is probably the most common theme in the world, and that's the only resemblance between those the movie and Romeo and Juliet. There's an enormous difference - Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, for one. Let's just say that this movie is nothing like Romeo and Juliet.

Moreover, if you have a basic knowledge of Shakespeare, you will know that Shakespeare created nothing. His story of Romeo and Juliet comes from an earlier story of the same name, which in turn comes from the Metamorphoses by Ovid, who probably heard the story as a folktale. His other tragedies - Hamlet, King Lear - are the same. The true excellence of Shakespeare is in his ability to transform them masterfully into blank verse. It has nothing to do with creativity, and here Borden is awfully wrong to claim that the best is Shakespeare's plot - which has been around for centuries. It shows a lack of basic knowledge about what he supposedly based his story on.

All this raises doubt to the amount of truth in Borden's claim that he based it on Romeo and Juliet - is it babbling, or is he simply ignorant? We do not know. But we do know that his comparison is, at best, doubtful. Yes, it is a verifiable source, it comes from the writer's own mouth, and it is not my place to judge him wrong, but it is also against the principle of common sense to make the comparison in an encyclopedia based on one sentence out of the writer's mouth - as far as I know, no one yet has made this comparison and no one seems to see the same way. I would suggest moving the sentence below to the plotline as """"The writer of the play claimed that..."""" as it is not exactly a notable claim either (nowhere else in the article is it mentioned, except briefly in what I believe is an OR sentence). Or, better, remove it.   
I think the editor seemed to feel that what Borden said was sufficient. I'd be a little dubious because; besides it being possibly self-promotion, the only thing we can grab without a shadow of a doubt that (like what you said about the Bard) they weren't that creative.    

Ok - I have now posted 5 more references not from the author, but from mainstream critics who easily saw the similar elements. I also fixed the dead link. I also retooled the sentence to say that both the author and numerous critics have made the same (or similar) description.  As to the obvious similarities: meeting at a party, a balcony scene, each has their """"gangs"""", the thwarting of a parents will, rival cliques instead of rival gangs is also referenced by 3 different critics. May this be the end to this conversation now? Thanks for allowing me to post more references.  Please read them all and you might learn something.  
Oh yes - of course their are elements of Grease and West Side Story - They too were based on elements of the R&J; story. I feel silly even having to point this stuff out, but it keeps coming up. Let's see - Grease wasn't a tragedy either (except its message of """"dress and act like a slut and you will be accepted"""".  Shakespeare created nothing? Gee, I guess that is why R&J; is perhaps the most adapted play of all time. See the wiki article on Romeo and Juliet on screen just for a taste of what the play has inspired.  No one has adapted Ovid and few have even read Romeus and Iuliet (I have though - has anyone on this page read it?). I sincerely doubt if Bordon or many critics have. And just so you know - Shakespeare did indeed add to the plot and created characters that hav",0

They were involved in the holocaust, it's a fact, ask any Estonian Jew. Jews always were in every independence movement so somwhere they would be excepted. I saw a ducumentary with Jews from Estonia who menneged to escape with the Soviets, and also Estinian vitnesses, and they told how Estonians closed hundreeds of Jews in every synogoge and burned them down. You're right about what was with the Jews in USSR (I'm half Jewish, my mother is Jewish, and my grand-grandpa set in Jail there for a short time for teaching Hebrew), but nevertheless, the Soviets didn't give to Estonians to make pogroms at Jews. By the way, at the days of the Tallin Liberator reburial there were many interviews with Jews from Estonia telling how Estonians murdered their people then. 
All the Jewqish community activities in the 80s and 90s was spoonsored by the Jews, and dont forget in 1987-1989 it was still the Soviet Union.

4346,"""

I agree that the prose style in the paragraph is lacking, if only a little. For instance the sentance """"those whose entire culture assumed they were a god, such as with the pharaohs"""" could easily be condensed to,""""those who were culturally assumed to be gods, such as Egyptian pharoahs"""" and to be entirely accurate (pun) I would have to add the pre-Columbian Meso-American kings to that phrase, and any other """"God-kings'. In removing the word """"entire"""" we remove any subjectivity. Was every single person in Egypt under the impression the pharoah was a god? Even the poor bastard who had to carry his stool out to dispose of it? More than likely not.

The edits made by multiple IP addresses on this page, as you know,  have been (not always but  by and large) at best unhelpful but much more often downright offensive and I see absolutely no reason why that should be allowed to continue.  Again, you know I am not talking about the juvenile HI MOMs - they are also annoying, but that is not what plagues this page.  We are plagued by targeted vandalism - changing """"Obama"""" to """"Osama"""", for example, and the regular changing of text that has hidden text clearly requesting that it not be changed right there, plus blatant POV pushing, trolling, etc.  Classic case for permanent sprot. The result, when sprot is in place, is the ability to conscientiously edit and improve the article (which has a changing base of facts so needs constant attention).  But rather than being able to easily evaluate substantive changes that responsible editors make, we are bogged down in having to go through screen after screen of pure and often vicious vandalism. For what positive reason, may I ask?

IP edits also can be used, I suppose, by regular editors who don't want to reveal that they are making sub rosa changes, but I would hope that is not going on here.  

And IP addresses have quite rarely reverted vandalism here - in fact I just looked at the last 500 edits and didn't see a single case of an IP address reverting vandalism. Maybe I missed one, but that claim was not really reflective of what goes on on this page - it is a very small group of actual editors who do the vast majority of the reverting.  

Your comment above about there being only one vandalism on Dec 21 was just one day after sprot was lifted the last time. I said then that I hoped to be wrong, but predicted that vandalism would be back up and it is.  That's why I requested extended protection.

If what  you were unhappy about is the tag itself, I also thought all along that we should have {{sprotect2}} and had thought to change it last time but the block was lifted before I had a chance to.   I have changed it to that less obtrusive tag.  The question of the duration  of the lock is what I am interested in. Two-three weeks is much better than what we had a few weeks ago, and may coincide with any announcement that Senator Obama makes which is also good timing for sprot, but  I'd like to understand why you would want it not to be an extended one, because I can't make any sense out of your position on this, as a person (you, I mean) who clearly is interested in having this remain a high quality page, as evidenced by the excellent work you do here, and the fact that this page has been by far your main area of Wikipedia editing.    | talk

On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable?
Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on their talk page (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it?
The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page.

Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I """"continue to revert"""", also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you """"continue to revert"""".
If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus.
Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

When a numbered IP starts screwing with your article, you revert him. End of story. Everyone will back you up on that. Esecially since you're never supposed to delete sourcing from an article. Because people who do that put the article author in the situation you're in now.
I'm just annoyed because Rant Media does quite obviously deserve an article by WP's guidelines. However, because the people who've made Rant articles and SK articles on Wikipedia over the past 5 years have often done such a bad job, writing articles that read like spam, not following Wikipedia's standard format, we've now ended up in a situation where the AfD can result in a salt - that's where they """"salt the earth"""" so the article can never again be created.
And meanwhile, once this artilce is deleted, Sean Kennedy'll be spending another 6 months being all whiney and snitty about Wikipedia again. I won't be able to listen to him. 
Ultimately, to reach your goal, it doesn't matter what's right and wrong here. What matters is that the various Wikipedia editors in AfD see that you've followed the rules: that your article is as good as any others and that it's as well-sourced as any others. If you've been watching and listening to Sean Kennedy you already know that. Infiltration requires not being seen to be the enemy. 
Go look at Order of Nine Angles. That's an article I rescued from AfD. The article used to, ages ago, be quite frankly stupid. It's about a supposed Satanic cult, of which there's only 1 confirmed member. But since it was mentioned in half a dozen scholarly books or more, I managed to get the article accepted - by following the rules. It's the only real article I've ever worked on, and I had to learn all the footnoting and formatting from scratch. If I can make that article acceptable, you can easily make a RantMedia article acceptable. The problem is you're almost out of time - you can completely repair an article during AfD, and that will give you a chance to avoid a delete vote. But you'd have to start now.   """,0

I will eventually hire a professional writer to cull the popular pieces from all of my books into a popular book that will be published mainstream. These books I am doing now are simply my preliminary sketch books, like Leonardo's - keeping notes for the historical record. As such many people will find them interesting. Also, as I don't need the money, I have not been doing what authors usually do to promote their books. I am too busy creating new content right now. Remember I am in Star Trek and on some major TV Shows and on IPOD Radio with RU Sirius and will be doing more of that bye and bye. If I wanted to go the usual route I could.

3314,"Hi. The image I discussed at the FAC is shown left. The owner allowed me to use it on condition his name was given as copyright holder. Someone at FAC (I can't remember who) suggested it was best not to use it. This photo can probably be deleted.

The photo I'm now using was given to me. The photographer sent me the original, full-size master and gave permission to do with it as I want. I am therefore the owner of the image. It's the same when you sell a photo to Getty Images: by agreeing to sell, you relinquish ownership and grant copyright to the purchaser.

I was also given a photo of the cannon by Hew Prendergast, great grandson of General Sir Harry Prendergast, the man who defeated Burma in the third Anglo-Burmese war. It was Harry Prendergast who sent the Singora cannon back to England. Hew also said I could use his photo in whatever way I wanted without needing to credit him as the photographer.",0

 Your comments on Algebraic Topology 

Hi Dylan, I hope you're well. I'm not sure that I agree with your comments. Would you say that a knot was a topological object of study? Would you say that a polynomial was an algebraic object of study? If your answer to these two questions is """"yes"""", then how would you describe the Alexander polynomial, the HOMFLY polynomial and the Jones polynomial? They are algebraic constructions used to study toplogical objects, ergo part of algebraic topology. ~~  (Talk)   ~~ """,0
